Subject: CGAL 3.9 Released, Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
Body:

The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce the Release 3.9 
of CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.

Besides fixes to existing packages major features where added
in the following packages.

[...]

See http://www.cgal.org/releases.html for a complete list of changes.


The CGAL project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
easy-to-use, and efficient C++ software library of geometric data
structures and algorithms, like
- triangulations (2D constrained triangulations and Delaunay
  triangulations in 2D and 3D, periodic triangulations),
- Voronoi diagrams (for 2D and 3D points, 2D additively weighted
  Voronoi diagrams, and segment Voronoi diagrams),
- Boolean operations on polygons and polyhedra,
- Regularized Boolean operations on polygons with curved arcs
- arrangements of curves,
- mesh algorithms (2D Delaunay mesh generation and 3D surface mesh
  generation, surface mesh subdivision and parameterization),
- alpha shapes (in 2D and 3D),
- convex hull algorithms (in 2D, 3D and dD),
- operations on polygons (straight skeleton and offset polygon),
- search structures (kd trees for nearest neighbor search, and
  range and segment trees),
- interpolation (natural neighbor interpolation and placement of
  streamlines),
- optimization algorithms (smallest enclosing sphere of points or
  spheres, smallest enclosing ellipsoid of points, principal
  component analysis),
- kinetic data structures
