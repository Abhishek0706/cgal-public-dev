\cgal provides a large number of data structures and algorithms dedicated to
various applications. Most of these data structures and algorithms can be
combined to achieve extensive and complex geometric tasks. The tutorials aim at
providing help and ideas on how to use CGAL beyond the simple examples of the
User Manual.



\note So far, only one tutorial on surface reconstruction is available, but more
are expected to be published in future releases.
