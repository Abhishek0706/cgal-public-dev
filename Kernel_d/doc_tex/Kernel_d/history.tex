\section{Design and Implementation History}

This higher-dimensional kernel is the result of a long evolving
development. A first version of the kernel was offered as a LEDA
extension package ddgeo by Kurt Mehlhorn and Michael Seel. The
original design was driven by the realization of a d-dimensional
convex hull data type developed at the 
\ccHtmlNoLinksFrom{Max-Planck Institut f\"ur Informatik}.

The code base was discussed and reviewed within the \cgal\ kernel group
(of the low-dimensional kernel).  This led to the identification of
the concept interfaces and in parallel to adaptations according to the
evolution of the low-dimensional kernel.  The kernel was revised
based on suggestions by Herv\'e Br\"onnimann, Michael Hoffmann, and
Stefan Schirra.
