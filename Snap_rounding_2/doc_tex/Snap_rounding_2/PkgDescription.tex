\ccPkgSummary{
Snap Rounding is a well known method for converting
arbitrary-precision arrangements of segments into a fixed-precision
representation. In the study of robust geometric computing, it can be
classified as a finite precision approximation technique. Iterated
Snap Rounding is a modification of Snap Rounding in which each vertex
is at least half-the-width-of-a-pixel away from any non-incident
edge. This package supports both methods.}
