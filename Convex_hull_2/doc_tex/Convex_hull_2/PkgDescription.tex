\ccPkgSummary{This package provides functions
for computing convex hulls in two dimensions as well as functions for
checking if sets of points are strongly convex are not. There are also
a number of functions described for computing particular extreme
points and subsequences of hull points, such as the lower and upper
hull of a set of points.}
