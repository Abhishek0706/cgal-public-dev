/// BorderParameterizer_3 is a concept of class that parameterizes a given type of mesh,
/// 'Adaptor', which is a model of the ParameterizationMesh_3 concept.
///
/// Implementation note:
/// To simplify the implementation, BorderParameterizer_3 models know only the
/// ParameterizationMesh_3 class. They do not know the parameterization algorithm
/// requirements or the kind of sparse linear system used.
///
/// @heading Design Pattern:
/// BorderParameterizer_3 models are Strategies [GHJV95]: they implement
/// a strategy of border parameterization for models of ParameterizationMesh_3.
