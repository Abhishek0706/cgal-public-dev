\ccPkgSummary{This package provides functions
for partitioning polygons in monotone or convex polygons.
The algorithms can produce results with the minimal number of
polygons, as well as approximations which have no more than four 
times the optimal number of convex pieces but they differ in 
their runtime complexities.}
