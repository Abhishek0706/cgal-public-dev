  \ccPkgSummary{This package implements linear cell complexes, objects
    in \emph{d}-dimension with linear geometry. The combinatorial part
    of objects is described by a combinatorial map, representing all
    the cells of the object plus the incidence and adjacency relations
    between cells. Geometry is added on combinatorial maps simply by
    associating a \emph{Point} to each vertex of the map.
    
    Taking a 2D combinatorial map, and using 3D points, gives a
    linear cell complex equivalent to a \emph{Polyhedron\_3}.}
