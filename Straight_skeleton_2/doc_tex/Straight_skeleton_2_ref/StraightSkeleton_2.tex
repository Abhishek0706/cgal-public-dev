\ccDefinition

The concept \ccRefName\ describes the requirements for the data structure
used to represent a straight skeleton. It refines the concept
\ccc{HalfedgeDS} and adds additional requirements on the nested types
\ccc{Vertex}, \ccc{Halfedge}, and \ccc{Face} of the halfedge data structure.

\ccRefines
\ccc{HalfedgeDS}

\ccTypes
  \ccNestedType{Vertex}{A model of the \ccc{StraightSkeletonVertex_2} concept used to represent the vertices of the straight skeleton}{}
  \ccGlue
  \ccNestedType{Halfedge}{A model of the \ccc{StraightSkeletonHalfedge_2} concept used to represent the halfedges of the straight skeleton}{}
  \ccGlue
  \ccNestedType{Face}{Any model of the \ccc{StraightSkeletonFace_2} concept used to represent the faces of the straight skeleton}{}

\ccHasModels

\ccc{CGAL::Straight_skeleton_2<Traits,Items,Alloc>}.

This concept explicitly protects all the modifying operations of the base \ccc{HalfedgeDS} concept. Only the algorithm classes, or clients explicitly bypassing the protection mechanism, can modify a straight skeleton.
