\ccDefinition

The function \ccRefName\ creates a straight skeleton in the exterior of a 2D polygon with holes.

\ccInclude{CGAL/create_straight_skeleton_2.h}

\ccFunction
{template<class FT, class PointIterator, class K>
boost::shared_ptr< Straight_skeleton_2<K> >
create_exterior_straight_skeleton_2 
  ( FT            max_offset
  , PointIterator vertices_begin
  , PointIterator vertices_end
  , K const&      k = Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel
  ) ;
}
{returns a new \ccc{Straight_skeleton_2<K>} in the {\em limited exterior} of the 2D polygon $P$ given by the point sequence \ccc{[vertices_begin,vertices_end]}.
The skeleton in the {\em limited exterior} of $P$ is the skeleton in the interior of a polygon $Q$ with $P$ as its hole and a rectangular frame $F$ as outer boundary.
The outer boundary $F$ is constructed by enlarging the bounding box of $P$ a distance $d$. 
$d$ is a margin sufficiently large to allow an outer offset at dinstance \ccc{max_offset} to be obtained from this exterior skeleton, as computed by the function \ccc{compute_outer_frame_margin} 
}
