\ccDefinition

The class \ccRefName\ provides a model for the
\ccc{PolygonOffsetBuilderTraits_2} concept which is the traits class
required by the \ccc{Polygon_offset_builder_2} algorithm class. The class 
\ccRefName\ has one template argument: a 2D \cgal\ Kernel. This parameter must be a model for the \ccc{Kernel} concept, such as the \ccc{Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel}, which is the recommended one.\\
It is unspecified which subset of the kernel is used in this traits class (and by extension in the builder class). This is to avoid restricting the choices in the implementation.
