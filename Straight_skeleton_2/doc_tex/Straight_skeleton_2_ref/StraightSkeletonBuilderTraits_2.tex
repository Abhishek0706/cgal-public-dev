\ccDefinition

The concept \ccRefName\ describes the requirements for the geometric traits class required by the algorithm class \ccc{Straight_skeleton_builder_2<Gt,Ss>}.

\ccTypes
  \ccNestedType{Kernel}{A model of the \ccc{Kernel} concept.}{}
  \ccGlue
  \ccNestedType{FT}{A \ccc{SqrtFieldNumberType} provided by the kernel. This type is used to represent the
   coordinates of the input points, of the skeleton nodes and as the event time stored in the skeleton nodes.}{}
  \ccGlue
  \ccTypedef{boost::tuple<FT,FT> Vertex;}{A pair of (x,y) coordinates representing a 2D Cartesian point.}
  \ccGlue
  \ccTypedef{boost::tuple<Vertex,Vertex> Edge;}{A pair of vertices representing an edge}
  \ccGlue
  \ccTypedef{boost::tuple<Edge,Edge,Edge> EdgeTriple;}{A triple of edges representing an event}

\ccTwo{StraightSkeletonBuilderTraits_2}{}  
  
\ccNestedType{Equal_2}
{A predicate object type being a model of the \ccc{Kernel::Equal_2} function object concept.}

\ccNestedType{Left_turn_2}
{A predicate object type being a model of the \ccc{Kernel::LeftTurn_2} function object concept.}

\ccNestedType{Collinear_2}
{A predicate object type being a model of the \ccc{Kernel::Collinear_2} function object concept.}

\ccNestedType{Do_ss_event_exist_2}
{A predicate object type.\\
Must provide \ccc{bool operator()( EdgeTriple const& et) const}, which determines if, given the 3 \textit{oriented} lines defined by the 3 input edges (3 pair of points), there exist an Euclidean distance \ccc{t} $\geq 0$ for which the corresponding 3 \textit{offset lines at \ccc{t}} (parallel lines at an Euclidean distance of \ccc{t}) intersect in a single point.\\
\ccPrecond{each edge in the triple must properly define an oriented line, that is, such points cannot be coincident.}}

\ccNestedType{Compare_ss_event_times_2}
{A predicate object type.\\
Must provide \ccc{Comparison_result operator()( EdgeTriple const& x, EdgeTriple const& y) const}, which compares the \ccc{times} for the events determined by the edge-triples \ccc{x} and \ccc{y}.\\
The time of an event given by an edge triple (which defines 3 oriented lines) is the Euclidean distance \ccc{t} at which the corresponding offset lines at \ccc{t} intersect in a single point.\\
\ccPrecond{\ccc{x} and \ccc{y} must be edge-triples corresponding to events that actually exist (as determined by the predicate \ccc{Exist_sls_event_2}).}}

\ccNestedType{Compare_ss_event_distance_to_seed_2}
{A predicate object type.\\
Must provide \ccc{Comparison_result operator()( Point_2 const& p, EdgeTriple const& x, EdgeTriple const& y)}, which compares the Euclidean distance of the points of event for \ccc{x} and \ccc{y} to the point \ccc{p}.\\
The point of an event given by an edge triple (which defines 3 oriented lines) is the intersection point of the 3 corresponding offset lines at the time \ccc{t} of the event.\\
It must also provide \ccc{Comparison_result operator( EdgeTriple const& seed, EdgeTriple const& x, EdgeTriple const& y)()} which makes the same comparison as the first overload but where the seed point is given implicitly as the point of event for \ccc{seed}.\\
\ccPrecond{\ccc{seed}, \ccc{x} and \ccc{y} must be edge-triples corresponding to events that actually exist (as determined by the predicate \ccc{Exist_sls_event_2}).}}

\ccNestedType{Is_ss_event_inside_offset_zone_2}
{A predicate object type.\\
Must provide \ccc{bool operator()( EdgeTriple const& e, EdgeTriple const& zone)}, which determines if the point of event for \ccc{e} is inside the \textit{offset zone} defined by the 3 \textit{oriented} lines given by \ccc{zone}.\\
An offset zone given by 3 \textit{oriented} lines is the intersection of the halfplanes to the left of each oriented line.\\
\ccPrecond{\ccc{e} must be an edge-triple corresponding to an event that actually exist (as determined by the predicate \ccc{Exist_sls_event_2}), and the 3 oriented lines given by \ccc{zone} must be well defined (no point-pair can have coincident points).}}

\ccNestedType{Are_ss_events_simultaneous_2}
{A predicate object type.\\
Must provide \ccc{bool operator()( EdgeTriple const& x, EdgeTriple const& y)}, which determines if the events given by \ccc{x} and \ccc{y} are coincident in time and space; that is, both triples of offset lines intersect at the same point and at the same Euclidean distance from their sources.\\
\ccPrecond{\ccc{x} and \ccc{y} must be edge-triples corresponding to events that actually exist (as determined by the predicate \ccc{Exist_sls_event_2}).}}

\ccNestedType{Construct_ss_event_time_and_point_2}
{A construction object type.\\
Must provide \ccc{boost::tuple< boost::optional<FT>, boost::optional<Point_2> > operator()( EdgeTriple const& e)}, which given the 3 \textit{oriented} lines defined by the 3 input edges (3 pair of points), returns the Euclidean distance \ccc{t} $\geq 0$ and intersection point at which the corresponding 3 \textit{offset lines at \ccc{t}} intersect.\\
If the values cannot be computed, not even approximately (because of overflow for instance), an empty optional must be returned.\\
\ccPrecond{\ccc{e} must be an edge-triple corresponding to an event that actually exist (as determined by the predicate \ccc{Exist_sls_event_2}).}}

\ccNestedType{Construct_ss_vertex_2}
{A construction object type.\\
Must provide \ccc{Vertex operator()( Point_2 const& p)}, which given a \ccc{Point_2} \ccc{p} returns a Vertex encapsulating the corresponding (x,y) pair of \textit{Cartesian} coordinates.}

\ccNestedType{Construct_ss_edge_2}
{A construction object type.\\
Must provide \ccc{Edge operator()( Point_2 const& s, Point_2 const& t)}, which given source and target points \ccc{s} and \ccc{t} returns an Edge encapsulating the corresponding input segment (in \textit{Cartesian} coordinates.)}

\ccNestedType{Construct_ss_triedge_2}
{A construction object type.\\
Must provide \ccc{Triedge operator()( Edge const& e0, Edge const& e1, Edge const& e2)}, which given the 3 edges that define an event, \ccc{e0}, \ccc{e1} and \ccc{e2}, returns a Triedge encapsulating them.}
