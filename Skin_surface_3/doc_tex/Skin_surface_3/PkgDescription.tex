  \ccPkgSummary{ %
    This package allows to build a triangular mesh of a skin surface.
    Skin surfaces are used for modeling large molecules in biological
    computing. The surface is defined by a set of balls, representing
    the atoms of the molecule, and a shrink factor that determines the
    size of the smooth patches gluing the balls together.

    The construction of a triangular mesh of a smooth skin surface is
    often necessary for further analysis and for fast visualization.
    This package provides functions to construct a triangular mesh
    approximating the skin surface from a set of balls and a shrink
    factor. It also contains code to subdivide the mesh efficiently.
