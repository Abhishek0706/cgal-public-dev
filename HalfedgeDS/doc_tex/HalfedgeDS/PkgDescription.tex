\ccPkgSummary{A halfedge data structure is an edge-centered data structure
capable of maintaining incidence information of vertices, edges and
faces, for example for planar maps, polyhedra, or other orientable,
two-dimensional surfaces embedded in arbitrary dimension. Each edge is
decomposed into two halfedges with opposite orientations. One incident
face and one incident vertex are stored in each halfedge. For each
face and each vertex, one incident halfedge is stored. Reduced
variants of the halfedge data structure can omit some of these
information, for example the halfedge pointers in faces or the
storage of faces at all.}
