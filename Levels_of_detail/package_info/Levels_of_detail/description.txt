Levels Of Detail

This CGAL component implements a geometry processing pipeline for reconstructing 
a watertight 3D model from a point set that represents a piece of urban environment.
The returned model has various Levels Of Detail (LODs), which include footprints, 
shoe boxes, and the full version with all principle details.
