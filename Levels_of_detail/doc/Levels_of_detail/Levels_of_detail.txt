\section Levels_Of_Detail_Introduction Introduction

This CGAL component implements a geometry processing pipeline for reconstructing 
a 3D model from a point set or polygon mesh that represents urban environment. 
The returned model has various Levels Of Detail (LODs), which include footprints, 
shoe boxes, and the full version with all details.

\section Levels_Of_Detail_Design Design

Generic design.

Point set and polygon soup inputs.

\section Levels_Of_Detail_Parameters Parameters

Scale and noise parameters.

\section Levels_Of_Detail_Ground Ground

Planar and smooth ground + basic example.

\subsection Levels_Of_Detail_GroundPerformance Performance

Performance of smooth ground.

\subsection Levels_Of_Detail_GroundAdvance Advance

Retreiving ground points + example.

\section Levels_Of_Detail_Trees Trees

Trees 0, 1, 2 + basic example.

\subsection Levels_Of_Detail_TreesPerformance Performance

Performance of trees 0, 1, 2.

\subsection Levels_Of_Detail_TreesAdvance Advance

Step by step generation + parameters + retreaving steps + example.

\section Levels_Of_Detail_Buildings Buildings

Buildings 0, 1, 2 + basic example.

\subsection Levels_Of_Detail_BuildingsPerformance Performance

Performance of buildings 0, 1, 2.

\subsection Levels_Of_Detail_BuildingsAdvance Advance

Step by step generation + parameters + retreaving steps + example.

\section Levels_Of_Detail_LODs LODs

LODs 0, 1, 2 + basic example.

\subsection Levels_Of_Detail_LODsPerformance Performance

Performance of lods 0, 1, 2.

\section Levels_Of_Detail_History History

The levels of detail component with reconstruction of ground, trees, buildings,
and generic lod was developed by Dmitry Anisimov and Simon Giraudot supervised
by and with help of Pierre Alliez, Florent Lafarge, and Andreas Fabri.
