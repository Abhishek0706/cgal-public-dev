\ccNestedType{A_sparse_iterator}{A random access iterator type to go 
  columnwise over the constraint matrix $A$. The value type
  is an object that provides bidirectional sparse iterators
  for the column in question
  by member calls to \ccc{begin()} and \ccc{end()}.
  Such a column iterator \ccc{it} is sparse, providing \ccc{(index,value)}
  pairs of all non-zero elements of the column. The index is accessed
  by \ccc{it->first} and the value is accessed by \ccc{it->second}.
  }
  
\ccNestedType{A_iterator}{A random access iterator type to go 
  columnwise over the constraint matrix $A$. The value type
  is an random access iterator type for an individual column that
  goes over the entries in that column.}

\ccNestedType{B_iterator}{A random access iterator type to go over 
  the entries of the right-hand side $\qpb$.}

\ccNestedType{R_iterator}{A random access iterator type to go over the
  relations $\qprel$. The value type of \ccc{R_iterator} is
  \ccc{CGAL::Comparison_result}.}
