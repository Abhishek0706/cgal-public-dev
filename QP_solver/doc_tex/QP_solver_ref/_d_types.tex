\ccNestedType{D_sparse_iterator}{A random access iterator type to go 
  rowwise over the matrix $2D$. The value type
  is an object that provides bidirectional sparse iterators
  for the row in question
  by member calls to \ccc{begin()} and \ccc{end()}.
  Such a column iterator \ccc{it} is sparse, providing \ccc{(index,value)}
  pairs of all non-zero elements of the row. The index is accessed
  by \ccc{it->first} and the value is accessed by \ccc{it->second}.

\ccNestedType{D_iterator}{A random access iterator type to go rowwise 
  over the matrix $2D$. The value type
  is a random access iterator type for an individual row that
  goes over the entries in that row, up to (and including) the
  entry on the main diagonal.}
