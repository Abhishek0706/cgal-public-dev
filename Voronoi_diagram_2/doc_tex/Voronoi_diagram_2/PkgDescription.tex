\ccPkgSummary{
The 2D Voronoi diagram adaptor package provides an adaptor that adapts a
2-dimensional triangulated Delaunay graph to the corresponding
Voronoi diagram, represented as a doubly connected edge list (DCEL)
data structure. The adaptor has the ability to automatically
eliminate, in a consistent manner, degenerate features of the Voronoi
diagram, that are artifacts of the requirement that Delaunay graphs
should be triangulated even in degenerate configurations. Depending on
the type of operations that the underlying Delaunay graph supports,
the adaptor allows for the incremental or dynamic construction of
Voronoi diagrams and can support point location queries. }
