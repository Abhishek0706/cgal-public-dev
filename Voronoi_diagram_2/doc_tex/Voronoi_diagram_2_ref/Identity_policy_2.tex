\ccDefinition

The class \ccRefName\ provides a model for the \ccc{AdaptationPolicy_2}
concept. The first template parameter of the \ccRefName\ class must be a
model of the \ccc{DelaunayGraph_2} concept, whereas as the second
template parameter must be a model of the \ccc{AdaptationTraits_2} concept.
This policy rejects no edge and no face of the Delaunay graph, thus
giving a Voronoi diagram which is the true dual of the triangulation
Delaunay graph. The Voronoi diagram created with this adaptation
policy may have degenerate features, such as Voronoi edges of zero
length, or Voronoi faces of zero area. This policy assumes that the
Delaunay graph, that is adapted, allows for site insertions through an
\ccStyle{insert} method that takes as argument an object of type
\ccc{AT::Site_2}. The site inserter functor provided by this policy
uses the aforementioned \ccStyle{insert} method.
