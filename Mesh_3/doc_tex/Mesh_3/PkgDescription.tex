\ccPkgSummary{
This package is devoted to the generation of  isotropic simplicial
meshes discretizing 3D domains.
The domain to be meshed is a region of 3D space that has to be bounded.
The region may be connected or  composed of multiple components
and/or subdivided in several subdomains. 
The domain is input as an oracle able to answer
 queries, of a few different types, on the domain.
Boundary and subdivision surfaces  are either
smooth or piecewise smooth surfaces, formed with planar or curved surface patches.
Surfaces may exhibit 1-dimensional features (e.g. crease edges)
and 0-dimensional features (e.g. singular points as corners
 tips, cusps or darts), that have to be fairly
approximated in the mesh. }
