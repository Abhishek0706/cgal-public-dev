Package to collect various algorithms for constructing and deconstruction Minkowksi sums of a polygon and a disc

We provide:
* A new approximate construction
* An exact deconsturction with "full" information"
* A method to decide whether a polygon is eps-approximable with a Minkowski sum of a polygon and a disc
