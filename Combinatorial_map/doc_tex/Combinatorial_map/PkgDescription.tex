  \ccPkgHowToCiteCgal{cgal:d-cm-11b} \ccPkgSummary{This package
    implements Combinatorial Maps in \emph{d}-dimension. A combinatorial
    map is a data structure allowing to represent an orientable
    subdivided object by describing all the cells of the subdivision
    (for example in 3D vertices, edges, faces, volumes) and all the
    incidence and adjacency relationships between these cells.
    Information can be associated to cells thanks to attributes.

    In 2D, a combinatorial map is equivalent to an halfedge data
    structure.

    The package provides basic creations, modification operations, and
    several iterators allowing to run through some specific part of
    the object.}
