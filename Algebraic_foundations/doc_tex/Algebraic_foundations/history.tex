\section{Design and Implementation History}

The package is part of \cgal\ since release 3.3. Of course the package is based 
on the former Number type support of CGAL. This goes back to Stefan Schirra and Andreas Fabri. But on the other hand the package is to a large extend influenced 
by the experience with the number type support in \exacus~\cite{beh+-eeeafcs-05}, 
which in the main goes back to 
Lutz Kettner, Susan Hert, Arno Eigenwillig and Michael Hemmer. 
However, the package abstracts from the pure support for 
number types that are embedded on the real axis which allows the support of 
polynomials, finite fields, and algebraic extensions as well. See also related 
subsequent chapters.
