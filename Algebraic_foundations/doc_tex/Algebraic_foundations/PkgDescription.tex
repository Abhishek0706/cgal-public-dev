\ccPkgSummary{
This package defines what algebra means for \cgal, in terms of
concepts, classes and functions. The main features are:
(i) explicit concepts for interoperability of types 
(ii) separation between algebraic types (not necessarily embeddable
into the reals), and number types (embeddable into the reals).
