\ccPkgSummary{The package introduces a concept for a univariate 
\ccc{AlgebraicKernel_d_1} and a concept for bivariate \ccc{AlgebraicKernel_d_2}.
\ccc{AlgebraicKernel_d_1} provides univariate root solving as well as comparison 
and refinement of the resulting algebraic numbers. 
\ccc{AlgebraicKernel_d_2} provides about the same for bivariate polynomial. 
Beside the functionalities related to one bivariate polynomial, it is in 
particular possible to solve a $2\times2$ system and to compare and approximate 
the resulting intersection points. The computation of the sign of a 
polynomial at given point is also provide.}
