TODO: The users Manual is missing. However we should merge this submission with the AlgebraicKernel RS submission.  

\section{Introduction}

(to be refined)
The package introduces a concept for a univariate 
\ccc{AlgebraicKernel_d_1} and a concept for bivariate \ccc{AlgebraicKernel_d_2}.
\ccc{AlgebraicKernel_d_1} provides univariate root solving as well as comparison 
and refinement of the resulting algebraic numbers. 
\ccc{AlgebraicKernel_d_2} provides about the same for bivariate polynomial. 
Beside the functionalities related to one bivariate polynomial, it is in 
particular possible to solve a $2\times2$ system and to compare and approximate 
the resulting intersection points. The computation of the sign of a 
polynomial at given point is also provide.

\section{Design and Implementation History}

The concepts introduced within this package are based on those proposed in 
%ACS-TR-123101-01 and 
%Interface specification of algebraic kernel
%Eric Berberich, Michael Hemmer, Menelaos Karavelas, Sylvain Pion, Monique Teillaud, Elias Tsigaridas
ACS-TR-243301-01.
% Revision of interface specification of algebraic
% Eric Berberich, Michael Hemmer, Menelaos I. Karavelas, Monique Teillaud
In particular, we want to thank Menelaos Karavelas and Elias Tsigaridas for their initial contributions.
