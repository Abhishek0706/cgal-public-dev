This is just a collection of maybe even minor things that one may want to think of/ change in AoS_2. 

The Topology_traits provides a function dcel_updated. 
It initializes things in the top traits 
or synchronizes the top traits with the dcel. 
However, the name seems misleading, since its almost sounds like is_valid. 

is_in_face:
name does not reflect the fact that the function is supposed to ignore holes.

functions that determine whether a path is perimetric are implemented in 
Arrangement_on_surface_2_impl.h and  rely on a curve that supports every edge.
That is, they do not allow a path that touches or is on an open Boundary. 
An option may be to ask the TopTraits for the parameter_space_in_x/y of an edge, that is, with respect to its target.
