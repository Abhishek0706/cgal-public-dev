The 3D Swept Volume Mesh Generation package capability 
for the generation of a high quality mesh that approximates
 the outer boundary of a swept volume (SV). The approach 
comes with two guarantees. First, the approximation is 
conservative, i.e. the swept volume is enclosed by the 
output mesh. Second, the one-sided Hausdorff distance 
of the generated mesh to the swept volume is upper 
bounded by a user defined tolerance. Exploiting this 
tolerance the method produces an mesh which nicely 
adapts to the local complexity of the approximated swept 
volume boundary. The algorithm is two phased: a 
initialization phase that generates a conservative 
voxelization of the swept volume, and the actual 
mesh generation using the Mesh_3 package.
