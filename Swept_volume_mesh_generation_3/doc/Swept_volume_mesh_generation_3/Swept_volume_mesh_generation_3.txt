\section sec-sv-introduction Introduction 

The swept volume is defined as the set of all points touched by 
a solid (the generator) while performing a motion. 
The 3D Swept Volume Mesh Generation package is based on 
\cite cgal:SV-vDHS-2012 .
The package provides capability for the generation of a high quality mesh 
that approximates  the outer boundary of a swept volume (SV) that is 
define by a polyhedral object and a discreet trajectory describing the 
motion. 
The approach comes with two guarantees. First, the approximation is 
conservative, i.e. the swept volume is enclosed by the output mesh. Second, the 
one-sided Hausdorff distance of the generated mesh to the swept volume 
is upper bounded by a user defined tolerance.



\section sec-sv-definitions Definitions

The swept volume is defined as the entity of all points touched by 
a solid (the generator) under the transformations of either a 
continuous or discrete trajectory. 
Mathematical formulations describing the swept volume
include Jacobian rank deficiency methods, sweep differential equations 
and envelope theory; for a survey see the work of Abdel-Malek 
et al. \cite Abdel-Malek2004 . 
Numerical approximation of swept volume boundaries 
utilizing implicit modeling was introduced in \cite Schroeder94 .
For the special case of sweeping a polyhedral object,
 Weld and Leu \cite Weld90  have 
shown that it suffices to compute the swept volume of 
the polygonal faces, which leads
to ruled and developable surfaces and polygons of the generator itself. 
Polyhedral approximations of these surfaces were proposed 
by Abrams and Allen \cite Abrams00 .

Currently this package provides capabilities to approximate the 
swept volume given by a triangulated polyhedral surface and a 
discrete trajectory. Since it is impossible to know the true 
trajectory between two discrete steps we define the swept volume 
as illustrated in Figure \cgalFigureRef{sv-fig-prism}. Between 
two steps each triangle yields a prism with three ruled surfaces
that are  approximated and tessellated by inserting the diagonal 
with the lower dihedral angle. The union of all prism defined by all 
triangles and all trajectory steps defines the swept volume \f$SV\f$.

of which is approximated and tessellated by inserting the diagonal

The main class of this package is CGAL::Swept_volume_domain_3, which 
is a model of the concept MeshDomain_3. This means, for instance,
that an object of this class can be used to generate a mesh via the 
function CGAL::make_mesh_3() of the \ref PkgMesh_3 in order to 
generate an approximation of \f$SV\f$. Together with proper MeshCriteria_3
this can already provide a mesh with nice properties such as an lower 
bound on the smallest the angles of the surface mesh facets, see also 
CGAL::Mesh_criteria_3. 

However, it is also possible to obtain the following 
additional guarantees by using another MeshCriteria_3 that is 
constructed from an existing MeshCriteria_3 object using the 
member function 
CGAL::Swept_volume_domain_3::swept_volume_criteria_3_object():
First, the approximation is conservative, i.e. \f$SV\f$ is enclosed by the 
output mesh. 
Second, the one-sided Hausdorff distance 
of the generated mesh to \f$SV\f$ is upper bounded by a user defined 
tolerance. 

\section sec-sv-examples Examples

The following example reads the Standford bunny from an .off file and sweeps 
it along some trajectory.
