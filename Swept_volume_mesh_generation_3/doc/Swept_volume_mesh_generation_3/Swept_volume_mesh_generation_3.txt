The swept volume \f$ SV \f$ is defined as the set of all points touched by 
a solid (the generator) while performing a motion. 
Its computation plays an important role in computer aided design (CAD),
numerically controlled (NC) machining verification and 
graphical modeling. In robotics and motion planing 
the swept volume can be used for the determination of workspace 
or to efficiently verify that an already computed path remains valid while 
other parts of the design may change.

The 3D Swept Volume Mesh Generation package is based on 
\cite cgal:SV-vDHS-2012 .
The package provides capability for the generation of a high quality mesh 
that approximates  the outer boundary of a swept volume (SV). 
The approach comes with two guarantees. 
First, the approximation is 
conservative, i.e. the swept volume is enclosed by the 
output mesh. Second, the one-sided Hausdorff distance 
of the generated mesh to the swept volume is upper 
bounded by a user defined tolerance. Exploiting this 
tolerance the method produces an mesh which nicely 
adapts to the local complexity of the approximated swept 
volume boundary. The algorithm is two phased: a 
initialization phase that generates a conservative 
voxelization of the swept volume, and the actual 
mesh generation using the Mesh_3 package.



\section secmydefinitions Definitions

The swept volume is defined as the entity of all points touched by 
a solid (the generator) under the transformations of either a 
continuous or discrete trajectory.
