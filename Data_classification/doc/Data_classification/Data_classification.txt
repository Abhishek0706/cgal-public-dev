This component implements an algorithm that classifies a point cloud into a user-defined set of classes (such as ground, vegetation, buildings, etc.). A flexible API is provided so that the user can compute its own local attributes on the point cloud and define its own classes based on these attributes.

\section Data_classification_attributes Attributes

\section Data_classification_types Classification types

\section Data_classification_psc Point set classification

\section Data_classification_custom Defining custom attributes and types

\section Data_classification_example Example

The following example reads an input file (LIDAR point set in PLY format); computes 4 attributes (scatter, elevation, horizontality and non-planarity) from this input; defines 3 classification types (vegetation, ground and roof) along with the effects of attributes on them; classifies the point set; recovers the segmented input in 3 separated arrays.
