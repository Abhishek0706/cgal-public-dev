* Programming:
  - check that curves do not share a non-trivial component
  - work on TODOs in code
  - GMP issue with Bigfloat-IA-discards

* GPU
  - subresultants
  - subdivision

* Tuning
  - choose a good parameter for time ratio between bitstream and norm-test
  - avoid y-solve if all x-roots have mult=1
  - bitstream with precision handling (prec, BCK_at_alpha)

* Bugs
  - Rs-Kernel "hangs": gn4 
  - Rs-Kernel has problem with tooooo many computed bits

* Beyond
  - Use 2d-subdivision + sign check of R*'s as "real root isolator"
