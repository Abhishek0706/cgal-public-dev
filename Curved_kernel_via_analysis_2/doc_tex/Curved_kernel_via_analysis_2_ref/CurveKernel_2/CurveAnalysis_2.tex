\begin{ccRefConcept}{CurveAnalysis_2::StatusLine_1}

\ccDefinition

The \ccc{StatusLine_1} concept is meant to provide information
about the intersections of a curve with a vertical line at a given 
finite $x$-coordinate. Note that a curve can have a vertical line component 
at this coordinate and non-vertical components may intersect 
the status line respectively. 
With the help of the concept's methods one is able
to compute the local topology of the curve 
at the given vertical line $x = x_0$ for some finite $x_0$.
A status line an $x_0$ smaller than any $x$-coordinate of a curve's 
status lines captures the topology of the curve when approaching $x = -\infty$.
An analogue arguments holds for $x_0$ larger than any $x$-coordinate
of a curve's status lines and $x = +\infty$.
%at the given vertical line.
%Note that vertical lines at $x = \pm\infty$ are not allowed, since different 
%events (curve ends going to infinity with different non-horizontal asymptotes)
%would have equal $y$-coordinate ($\pm\infty$), which confuses more than it
%helps. 
Note in addition that curve ends approaching the vertical asymptote 
introduce an event (depending on whether approaching $+\infty$ or $-\infty$ -
but the event with coordinates $(x,-\infty)$, resp. $(x,+\infty)$, occur
only once, if they occur, and they imply not to be associated with
an instance of \ccc{Coordinate_2}.

for curves to be algebraic, hence the generic name. Only the number
of events must be finite.}

\ccDefinition

The \ccc{CurveKernel_2::CurveAnalysis_2} 
concept is meant to provide tools to analyse a single
curve. An analysis is meant to describe the curve's interesting points and how 
they are connected. The analysis searches for {\it events}. Events only
occur at a finite number of $x$-coordinates. Each such coordinate defines
a \ccc{StatusLine_1} of an event. These coordinates also define open 
{\it intervals} on the $x$-axis. Different 
\ccc{StatusLine_1} at values within one 
such interval only differ in the values of the \ccc{Coordinate_2} entries. 
Topological information are equal for all $x$-coordinate inside such an
open interval.

  [begin,end) contains factors of $\mbox{resultant}(p,p_y,y)$

Note that the access methods to status lines are not redundant! The ones
using an id-value are efficient for speed-ups (caching, avoids to search for
some $x$, or the unique representative status line for an interval). 
The others enable a user to compute status lines for given $x$, 
i.e., also to access $y$-coordinates at given $x$.

%  $s$'s $x$-coordinate, or -1 if $s$ is does not lie on the curve.

\ccMethod{CGAL::Object asymptotic_value_of_arc(CGAL::Arr_parameter_space loc, 
  size_type arcno);}{
  returns a CGAL::Object that encodes the asymptotic value of a curve-arc 
  approaching the left or the right boundary ($loc$) of the underlying
  parameter space. Allowed instantiations of the CGAL::Object are 
  \ccc{Coordinate_1}, in case the x-asympote of the arc is finite,
  or \ccc{CGAL::ARR_BOTTOM_BOUNDARY} and \ccc{CGAL::ARR_TOP_BOUNDARY} in case
  the defined arc approaches the respective corners of the parameter space.
  \ccPrecond{$loc$ is either \ccc{CGAL::ARR_LEFT_BOUNDARY} or 
    \ccc{CGAL::ARR_RIGHT_BOUNDARY}}
}

In our $y$-per-$x$-view we imagine the parameter space to be slightly 
``heigher'' than ``width'' and so we distinguish three aympototic behaviours
of arcs. Horizontal, vertical, and none of them. This member covers 
all non-vertical asymptotic values. We do not introduce a special one
for vertical asympototes as the respective $x$-coordinates are already defined
by proper status lines.

In addition, by using the parameter space locations, 
we decouple the interface from the unbounded plane. An example is a 
two-dimensional arrangement embedded on a torus.
