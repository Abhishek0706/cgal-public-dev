\ccPkgSummary{
Real solving of polynomials is a fundamental problem with a wide application range. 
This package is targeted to provide black-box implementations of state-of-the-art 
algorithms to determine, compare and approximate real roots of univariate polynomials
and bivariate polynomial systems. Such a black-box is called an {\em Algebraic Kernel}. 
So far the package only provides models for the univariate kernel. Nevertheless, 
it already defines concepts for the bivariate kernel, since this settles the interface
for upcoming implementations.}
