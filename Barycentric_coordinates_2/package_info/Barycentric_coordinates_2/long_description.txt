The package 2D Generalized Barycentric Coordinates offers an efficient and robust 
implementation of various two-dimensional generalized barycentric coordinates 
defined for simple two-dimensional polygons. If coordinates with respect to multivariate 
scattered points instead of a polygon are required, please refer to natural-neighbor coordinates 
from the package 2D and Surface Function Interpolation.
