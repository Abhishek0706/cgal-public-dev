1. Should we merge natural-neighbor coordinates and barycentric coordinates?
2. Should I skip all non-valid points or fill output iterator with -1 values?
Or maybe return a vector with the corresponding point index?
3. Should I create a wrapper for the HarmonicCoordinatesDomain concept or any
Triangulation_2-based types are fine?
