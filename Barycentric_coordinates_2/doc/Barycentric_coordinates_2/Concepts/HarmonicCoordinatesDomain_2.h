\cgalConcept

A concept that describes the set of methods that should be defined for all
input domains such as CGAL triangulations, for example, which can be used to
compute harmonic coordinates inside a simple polygon.

This concept follows the requirements by a constrained Delaunay triangulation
from CGAL, where constraints are the polygon edges.
