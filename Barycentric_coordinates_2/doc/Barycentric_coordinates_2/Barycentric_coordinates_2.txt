\section gbc_introduction Introduction

This package offers an efficient and robust implementation of two-dimensional 
closed-form generalized barycentric coordinates defined for simple two-dimensional polygons. 
If coordinates with respect to multivariate scattered points instead of a polygon are required, 
please refer to natural neighbor coordinates from the package \ref chapinterpolation "2D and Surface Function Interpolation".

In particular, this package includes an implementation of \ref wp_example "Wachspress", 
\ref mv_example "mean value", \ref dh_example "discrete harmonic", and \ref hm_example "harmonic" coordinates, and 
provides some extra functions to compute barycentric coordinates with respect 
to \ref seg_example "segments" and \ref tri_example "triangles". 
See also Section \ref gbc_theory for a short introduction to the topic of barycentric coordinates.


\section gbc_interface Software Design

Each class that computes barycentric coordinates is parameterized by a traits class. 
This traits class defines types and geometric primitives, which are used in the computation 
and must be a model of the concept `BarycentricTraits_2`.

The main entry point to the component is a `ConstRange` of generic items, which contain vertices of a polygon.
The vertices are accessed through a \ref PkgPropertyMapRef "propery map" that maps a user-defined type of the item to `CGAL::Point_2`.
The vertices must follow clockwise or anticlockwise ordering. Query points can also be provided
as a `ConstRange` of generic items with the corresponding \ref PkgPropertyMapRef "propery map".

Mean value and harmonic coordinates are the most generic coordinates in this package,
because they allow an arbitrary simple polygon as input. Wachspress and discrete harmonic coordinates 
are, by definition, limited to strictly convex polygons. Segment coordinates take as input 
any non-degenerate segment, and triangle coordinates allow an arbitrary non-degenerate triangle.

Segment and triangle coordinates can be computed through the corresponding global functions. 
All generalized coordinates can be computed by creating a model of `AnalyticWeights_2`. 
These models provide either unnormalized or normalized generalized barycentric weights, 
which depends on the chosen type of coordinates. If the weights are unnormalized, they can be 
normalized through one of the global functions from `CGAL::Barycentric_coordinates`.

Any point in the plane may be taken as a query point. However, we do not recommend 
to use Wachspress and discrete harmonic coordinates with query points outside the closure 
of a polygon, because they are not well-defined for some of these points. The same holds 
for harmonic coordinates, which are not defined at any point in the polygon's exterior. See more 
in Section \ref gbc_degeneracies.

Once instantiated for a polygon, generalized coordinates can be computed multiple times 
for different query points with respect to the polygon's vertices. See 
\ref PkgBarycentric_coordinates_2 "Reference Manual" for the detailed interface.

The output of the computation is a set of coordinate values at the given query point 
with respect to the polygon's vertices. This output can be stored in an arbitrary container 
providing an appropriate `OutputIterator`. The ordering of the coordinates is the same
as the ordering of the polygon's vertices. In addition, all the methods and functions 
return a pointer to the last stored element and a status of the computation (Boolean true or false).


\section gbc_examples Examples

In order to facilitate the process of learning this package, we provide various examples 
with basic uses of different barycentric components.


\subsection seg_example Segment Coordinates

This example shows the use of the global function `CGAL::Barycentric_coordinates::segment_coordinates_2()`. 
We compute coordinates at three green points along the segment \f$[v_0, v_1]\f$ and at two blue points outside this segment 
but along its supporting line. The symmetry of the query points helps recognizing errors that 
may have occured during construction of the example. The used `Kernel` is exact.

\subsection tri_example Triangle Coordinates

In this example, we show how to use the global function `CGAL::Barycentric_coordinates::triangle_coordinates_2()`. 
We compute coordinates for three sets of points: interior (green), boundary (red), and exterior (blue). 
Note that some of the coordinate values for the exterior points are negative. 
The used `Kernel` is of floating precision.

\cgalExample{Barycentric_coordinates_2/triangle_coordinates.cpp}


\subsection wp_example Wachspress Coordinates

In the following example, we generate 100 random points, then we take the convex hull 
of this set of points as our polygon, and compute Wachspress coordinates at 
all the generated points. The used `Kernel` is of floating precision.

\cgalExample{Barycentric_coordinates_2/Wachspress_coordinates.cpp}


\subsection dh_example Discrete Harmonic Coordinates

In this example, we compute discrete harmonic coordinates for a set of green (interior), 
red (boundary), and blue (exterior) points with respect to a unit square. We also show 
that package accepts various containers, both random access and not, different property maps,
and lets the user choose a `CGAL::Barycentric_coordinates::Computation_policy`.
The used `Kernel` is inexact.

\cgalExample{Barycentric_coordinates_2/discrete_harmonic_coordinates.cpp}


\subsection mv_example Mean Value Coordinates

This is an example that shows how to compute mean value coordinates for a set of green points 
in a star-shaped polygon. We note that this type of coordinates is well-defined for such a concave polygon 
while Wachspress and discrete harmonic coordinates are not. However, it may give negative 
coordinate values for points outside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-shaped_polygon">the polygon's kernel</a> 
(shown in red). We speed up the computation using a faster `CGAL::Barycentric_coordinates::Computation_policy` and 
inexact `Kernel`.

\subsection hm_example Harmonic Coordinates
This example shows how to create a discretized Delaunay domain restricted to a polygon,
instantiate an \ref thirdpartyEigen "Eigen" sparse solver, and compute harmonic coordinates 
at all the vertices of the domain. Once computed, harmonic coordinate functions can then be evaluated 
at any point in the closure of the polygon. Since harmonic coordinates can only be approximated, 
the used `Kernel` is inexact.

\cgalExample{Barycentric_coordinates_2/harmonic_coordinates.cpp}


\subsection height_inter_example Height Interpolation for Terrain Modeling

This is an advanced example that shows how to use generalized barycentric coordinates 
for height interpolation with applications to terrain modeling. It also shows how to use 
a non-default traits class with our package instead of a `Kernel` traits class. 
Suppose we know the boundary of three-dimensional piece of terrain that can be represented 
as a polygon with several three-dimensional vertices, where the third dimension gives 
the corresponding height. The task is to propagate the height from the known sample points 
on the boundary to the polygon's interior. This gives an approximate estimation of 
the terrain's surface in this region.

\cgalFigureBegin{terrain_example, terrain.png}
A 2D polygon with 50 vertices representing a piece of terrain with convex and concave parts. The height is not shown.
\cgalFigureEnd

In this example, we project a three-dimensional polygon orthogonally onto the two-dimensional plane 
using the class `CGAL::Projection_traits_xy_3`, triangulate its interior using the class `CGAL::Barycentric_coordinates::Delaunay_domain_2`, 
and compute mean value coordinates at the vertices of this triangulation with respect to the polygon's vertices. 
Finally, we interpolate the height data from the polygon's boundary to its interior 
using the computed coordinates and the global interpolation function from the 
package \ref chapinterpolation "2D and Surface Function Interpolation".

\cgalExample{Barycentric_coordinates_2/terrain_height_modeling.cpp}

As a result, we get a smooth function inside the polygon that approximates the underlying terrain's surface.

\subsection af_example Affine Coordinates
This is another advance example, where we show how the global functions from `CGAL::Barycentric_coordinates` 
can be used with <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda">lambda expressions</a>.
To make this example useful, we implement affine generalized coordinates for a set 
of scattered points. The used `Kernel` is of floating precision.

\section gbc_degeneracies Edge Cases

Not all presented coordinates are general enough to handle any query point in the plane, that is
why we highly recommend to address this section in order to learn what can be expected from 
each class.


\anchor compute_seg_coord
\subsection gbc_deg_segment_coordinates Segment Coordinates

Segment coordinates can be computed exactly if an exact data type is chosen. 
The segment itself, with respect to which we compute coordinates, must be non-degenerate. 
If both conditions are satisfied, then the computation never fails. However, to compute coordinates, 
the user must be sure about the query point being exactly on the line \f$L\f$ supporting the segment. 
Since in many applications this is not the case, and a query point may lie very close but not exactly on this line, 
the class is also able to handle this situation.

\cgalFigureBegin{projection, projection.png}
The orthogonal projection \f$p'\f$ of the vector \f$p\f$ (green) onto the vector \f$q\f$ (red).
\cgalFigureEnd

Suppose that some query point \f$v\f$ does not lie exactly on the line \f$L\f$, 
but is some distance \f$d\f$ away as shown in the figure above. If we want to compute 
the segment barycentric coordinate \f$b_1(v)\f$ with respect to the vertex \f$v_1\f$, 
we first find the orthogonal projection \f$p'\f$ of the vector \f$p\f$ onto the vector \f$q\f$ and 
then normalize it by the length of \f$q\f$. This gives the segment barycentric 
coordinate \f$b_1(v') = b_1(v)\f$ if \f$v\f$ lies exactly on the line.

\b Warning: do not abuse the feature described above, because it does not give correct 
segment barycentric coordinates for the point \f$v\f$ but rather those for \f$v'\f$. 
Moreover, segment barycentric coordinates for a point \f$v\f$, which does not lie exactly on the line \f$L\f$, 
do not exist. But if the non-zero distance \f$d\f$ is due to some numerical instability 
when computing the location of the point \f$v\f$ or any other problem, 
which causes the point to be not exactly on the line, the final segment coordinates will be, 
at least approximately, correct.

With inexact data types, the resulting coordinate values are correct up to the precision of the chosen type.


\subsection gbc_deg_triangular_coordinates Triangle Coordinates

These coordinates can be computed exactly if an exact data type is chosen, for any query point 
in the plane and with respect to any non-degenerate triangle. No special cases are handled. 
The computation always gives the correct result. The notion of correctness depends on the precision 
of the used data type. Note that for exterior points some coordinate values will be negative.


\subsection gbc_deg_wachspress_coordinates Wachspress Coordinates

Wachspress coordinates are well-defined in the closure of any <em>strictly convex polygon</em>. 
Therefore, for any query point from the polygon's closure with an exact data type, 
these coordinates are computed exactly and no false result is expected. 
For inexact data types, the resulting precision of the computation is due to the involved algorithm 
and chosen data type. In the following paragraph, we discuss two available algorithms 
for computing Wachspress coordinates. The chosen algorithm is defined by `CGAL::Barycentric_coordinates::Computation_policy`.

\anchor wp_polygon
\cgalFigureBegin{wp_notations, wp_notations.png}
Notation for Wachspress coordinates.
\cgalFigureEnd

To compute Wachspress weights, we follow \cgalCite{cgal:bc:fhk-gcbcocp-06} and use the formula

<center>\f$w_i = \frac{C_i}{A_{i-1}A_i}\f$</center>

with \f$i = 1\dots n\f$ where \f$n\f$ is the number of the polygon's vertices. 
In order to compute the coordinates, we normalize these weights,

<center>\f$b_i = \frac{w_i}{W^{wp}}\qquad\f$ with \f$\qquad W^{wp} = \sum_{j=1}^n w_j.\f$</center>

This formula becomes unstable when approaching the boundary of the polygon (\f$\approx 1.0e-10\f$ and closer). 
To fix the problem, we modify the weights \f$w_i\f$ as

<center>\f$\bar{w}_i = C_i\prod_{j\not=i-1,i} A_j\f$.</center>

After the normalization as above, this gives us the precise algorithm to compute Wachspress coordinates 
but with \f$O(n^2)\f$ performance only. The max speed \f$O(n)\f$ algorithm uses the standard 
weights \f$w_i\f$. Note that mathematically this modification does not change the coordinates. But you should
be cautious when using the unnormalized Wachspress weights. In this case, you must choose the 
\f$O(n)\f$ type. 

It is known that for strictly convex polygons the denominator's zero set of the 
Wachspress coordinates (\f$W^{wp} = 0~\f$) is a curve, which (in many cases) lies quite 
far away from the polygon. Speaking precisely, it interpolates the intersection points of 
the continuations of the polygon's edges. Therefore, the computation of Wachspress coordinates 
outside the polygon is possible only at points that do not belong to this curve.

\b Warning: we do not recommend to use Wachspress coordinates for exterior points!


\subsection gbc_deg_discrete_harmonic_coordinates Discrete Harmonic Coordinates

Discrete harmonic coordinates have the same requirements as Wachspress coordinates. 
They are well-defined in the closure of any <em>strictly convex polygon</em> and, 
if an exact data type is chosen, they are computed exactly. But, unlike Wachspress basis functions, 
these coordinates are not necessarily positive. In particular, the weight \f$w_i\f$ is positive 
if and only if \f$\alpha+\beta < \pi\f$ (see the figure below for notation). For inexact data types, 
the precision of the computation is due to the involved algorithm and chosen data type. Again, 
we describe two algorithms to compute the coordinates: one is of max precision and one is of max speed.

\anchor dh_polygon
\cgalFigureBegin{dh_notations, dh_notations.png}
Notation for discrete harmonic coordinates.
\cgalFigureEnd

To compute discrete harmonic weights, we follow \cgalCite{cgal:bc:fhk-gcbcocp-06} and use the formula

<center>\f$w_i = \frac{r_{i+1}^2A_{i-1}-r_i^2B_i+r_{i-1}^2A_i}{A_{i-1}A_i}\f$</center>

with \f$i = 1\dots n\f$ where \f$n\f$ is the number of the polygon's vertices. 
In order to compute the coordinates, we normalize these weights,

<center>\f$b_i = \frac{w_i}{W^{dh}}\qquad\f$ with \f$\qquad W^{dh} = \sum_{j=1}^n w_j.\f$</center>

This formula becomes unstable when approaching the boundary of the polygon (\f$\approx 1.0e-10\f$ and closer). 
To fix the problem, similarly to the previous subsection, we modify the weights \f$w_i\f$ as

<center>\f$\bar{w}_i = (r_{i+1}^2A_{i-1}-r_i^2B_i+r_{i-1}^2A_i)\prod_{j\not=i-1,i} A_j\f$.</center>

After the normalization as above, this gives the precise algorithm to compute discrete harmonic coordinates 
but with \f$O(n^2)\f$ performance only. The max speed \f$O(n)\f$ algorithm uses the standard 
weights \f$w_i\f$. Again, mathematically this modification does not change the coordinates, 
but you should be cautious when using the unnormalized discrete harmonic weights. In this case, you must choose the 
\f$O(n)\f$ type.

\b Warning: as for Wachspress coordinates, we do not recommend to use discrete harmonic coordinates 
for exterior points, because the curve \f$W^{dh} = 0\f$ may have several components, 
and one of them interpolates the polygon's vertices. However, if you are sure that 
the query point does not belong to this curve, you can compute the coordinates 
as shown in \ref dh_example " this example".


\subsection gbc_deg_mean_value_coordinates Mean Value Coordinates

Unlike the previous coordinates, mean value coordinates cannot be computed exactly due to 
an inevitable square root operation. Although, if an exact data type is used, the default precision 
of the computation depends only on two \cgal functions: `CGAL::to_double()` and `CGAL::sqrt()`. 
On the other hand, mean value coordinates are well-defined everywhere in the plane for any simple polygon. 
In addition, if your traits class provides a more precise version of the square root function, 
the final precision of the computation with exact data types will depend only on the precision of that function.

\anchor mv_polygon
\cgalFigureBegin{mv_notations, mv_notations.png}
Notation for mean value coordinates.
\cgalFigureEnd

For these coordinates we also have two algorithms: one is of max precision and one is of max speed. 
The first one works everywhere in the plane, and the precision of the computation depends only 
on the chosen data type, including the remarks above. This algorithm is based on the following weight 
formula from \cgalCite{cgal:bc:f-wmvc-14}

<center>\f$w_i = \sigma_i\bar{w}_i\qquad\f$ with \f$\qquad\bar{w}_i = (r_{i-1}r_{i+1}-d_{i-1}d_{i+1})^{1/2}\prod_{j\not= i-1,i}(r_jr_{j+1} + d_jd_{j+1})^{1/2}\qquad\f$ 
where \f$\qquad r_i = \|d_i\|.\f$</center>

Since \f$\bar{w}_i\f$ is always positive, we have to append to it the proper sign \f$\sigma_i\f$ 
of the signed mean value weight, which can be found efficiently (see the figures below). 
Basically, this weight is always positive to the left of the red piecewise linear curve, 
and it is negative to the right of this curve, moving in anticlockwise direction.

\cgalFigureBegin{mv_weight_signs,mv_weight_signs_convex.png,mv_weight_signs_concave.png}
Signs of the mean value weight \f$w_i\f$ depending on the region with respect to a 
convex polygon \f$P\f$ and a concave polygon \f$P'\f$.
\cgalFigureEnd

After the normalization of these weights as before

<center>\f$b_i = \frac{w_i}{W^{mv}}\qquad\f$ with \f$\qquad W^{mv} = \sum_{j=1}^n w_j\f$</center>

we obtain the max precision \f$O(n^2)\f$ algorithm. The max speed O(n) algorithm computes the 
weights \f$w_i\f$ using the pseudocode from <a href="http://www.inf.usi.ch/hormann/nsfworkshop/presentations/Hormann.pdf">here</a>. 
These weights

<center>\f$w_i = \frac{t_{i-1} + t_i}{r_i}\qquad\f$ 
with \f$\qquad t_i = \frac{\text{det}(d_i, d_{i+1})}{r_ir_{i+1} + d_id_{i+1}}\f$</center>

are also normalized. Note that they are unstable if a query point is closer than \f$\approx 1.0e-10\f$ 
to the polygon's boundary, similarly to Wachspress and discrete harmonic coordinates and 
you should be cautious when using the unnormalized mean value weights. In this case, you must choose the 
\f$O(n)\f$ type.


\subsection gbc_deg_harmonic_coordinates Harmonic Coordinates

Harmonic coordinates are the only coordinates in this package, which are guaranteed to be 
non-negative in the closure of any simple polygon, however the nice properties come with the 
fact that these coordinates are well-defined only in the closure of a polygon. Hence,
any exterior query points cannot be provided. If they are, the returned coordinates for these 
points will be set to zeros. 

Another disadvantage of these functions is that they cannot be computed 
exactly, because harmonic coordinates do not have a simple analytic formula but are rather
approximated. From this follows, that any exact `Kernel` will be rejected. 

The speed of the computation and the final precision depend mainly on two factors: 
the used solver for the internal linear system and the size of this system that comes 
from the density of the discretized domain constrained by the input polygon. The smaller
finite elements in the discretezation the more precise coordinates and the slower computation.

...figures with discretized domains to be added later...


\section gbc_performance Performance

Apart from the most important requirement on barycentric coordinates to be as precise as possible, 
it is very important for them to be as fast as possible to evaluate. These coordinates are used 
in many applications where they must be computed for millions of points and, thus, the real time usage 
of coordinates is crucial. When writing the code, we tried to fulfil this important requirement, 
and in this section we present a few results about the computation times of the implemented coordinates.

The structure of the speed test that we ran for all functions consists of computing coordinate values 
(or weights) at >= 1 million strictly interior points with respect to some polygon (or triangle, or segment). 
At each iteration of the loop we create a query point, pass it to the function, and compute all the related coordinates. 
We run this loop 10 times in a row, and the time presented in the log-log scale plot at the end of the section 
is the arithmetic mean of all trials.

The time to compute coordinates depends on many factors such as memory allocation, input kernel, output container, 
number of points, etc. In our tests, we used the most standard C++ and \cgal features with minimum memory allocation. 
Therefore, the final time presented is the average time that can be expected without deep optimization 
but still with efficient memory allocation. It also means that it may vary depending on the usage of the package.

For all tests above, we used a MacBook Pro 2011 with 2 GHz Intel Core i7 processor (2 cores) 
and 8 GB 1333 MHz DDR3 memory. The installed operating system was OS X 10.9 Maverick. 
In order to compile the speed test suite, we used the Clang 5.0 64bit compiler. 
The resulting timings for all closed-form coordinates can be found in the figure below.

\cgalFigureBegin{time, time.png}
Time in seconds to compute \f$n\f$ coordinate values for a polygon with \f$n\f$ vertices 
at 1 million points with the max speed \f$O(n)\f$ algorithms (dashed) and the max precision \f$0(n^2)\f$ algorithms (solid) 
for Wachspress (blue), discrete harmonic (red), and mean value (green) coordinates.
\cgalFigureEnd

From the figure above it is easy to see that the \f$O(n^2)\f$ algorithm is as fast 
as the \f$O(n)\f$ algorithm if we have a polygon with a small number of vertices. 
But as the number of vertices is increased, the linear algorithm outperforms the squared one, 
as expected. One of the reasons for this behavior is that for a small number of vertices 
the multiplications for \f$n-2\f$ elements inside the \f$O(n^2)\f$ algorithm with 
the \f$O(n)\f$ algorithms (dashed) and the \f$O(n^2)\f$ algorithms (solid) take almost the 
same time as the corresponding division in the \f$O(n)\f$ algorithm. For a polygon with many vertices, 
this multiplication is much slower.

We, on purpose, did not compare the timings to compute the closed-form coordinates with 
harmonic coordinates. The latter functions require a solution of a linear system and 
thus are much slower in practice. In order to show their average performance, we present 
a table below, where these coordinates are instantiated with different solvers and 
on domains of varying density. We also compare the time to create a discretized domain,
compute the coordinates, and evaluate the coordinate functions at 1 million strictly interior points.

...table to be added later...


\section gbc_implementation Implementation Details

The package consists of 5 classes, 2 enumerations, one namespace, and 11 global functions. 
Once instantiated, the coordinates can be computed multiple times for different query points.
All the classes / functions are fully templated and have a simple and similar design.

The implemented algorithms for computing coordinates do not depend on a particular 
kernel except for harmonic coordinates. Apart from mean value and harmonic coordinates, 
all other coordinates can be computed exactly if an exact kernel is used. Mean value 
coordinates involve a square root operation, which results in a slightly worse precision 
with exact data types due to temporal conversion into a floating point type. Harmonic coordinates 
are approximated and thus cannot be computed exactly.

It is worth noting that the function `CGAL::Barycentric_coordinates::segment_coordinates_2()` is used 
to compute generalized barycentric coordinates along the polygon's boundary, for example when 
applying `CGAL::Barycentric_coordinates::boundary_coordinates_2()`. Hence, one can use 
the trick for segment coordinates from Section \ref gbc_degeneracies if one is convinced 
that a point must lie exactly on the polygon's boundary but due to some numerical instabilities it does not.

Similarly, the function `CGAL::Barycentric_coordinates::triangle_coordinates_2()` is used 
when evaluating harmonic coordinate functions by first locating a triangle in the discretized 
domain and then interpolating harmonic coordinates within this triangle. We also use 
`CGAL::Barycentric_coordinates::Discrete_harmonic_weights_2` when setting the linear system 
for computing harmonic coordinates.

The package is implemented in a way that later, if needed, 
other two-dimensional generalized barycentric coordinates can be easily added to this package.


\section gbc_theory Theory

In 1827, the German mathematician and theoretical astronomer 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Ferdinand_Möbius">August Ferdinand Möbius</a> (1790--1868) 
proposed a method \cgalCite{cgal:bc:m-dbc-27} to find coordinates of a point in the plane 
with respect to the vertices of a triangle. These coordinates are 
called <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BarycentricCoordinates.html">triangle barycentric coordinates</a> 
(sometimes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinate_system">area coordinates</a>), 
and they are widely used in a variety of applications. Some of these applications are linear interpolation 
over a triangle and a triangle inclusion test. The first one is used for 
so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shading">shading</a>, and the second one arises 
in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasterization">rasterization</a> step when an image 
in vector graphics format needs to be converted into a raster image.

Triangle barycentric coordinates have many important properties, 
including \em constant and <em>linear precision</em>, <em> the Lagrange property</em>, 
and <em>positivity inside a triangle</em>. These properties make these coordinates a unique tool 
in many scientific fields. If we restrict triangle coordinates to one of the edges of a triangle 
and its supporting line, we get barycentric coordinates with respect to a segment and 
call them \ref compute_seg_coord "segment coordinates".

Let us show a couple of plots for the coordinates described above. To plot segment coordinates, 
we take a line \f$y = 0.4\f$ and define \ref seg_example "a segment" \f$[v_0, v_1]\f$ on this line. 
Then we sample this segment and compute segment coordinates for all the sample points. 
If we plot the segment coordinate function at all the defined points with respect to the 
vertex \f$v_1\f$, we get the blue line depicted in the figure below. It grows from zero 
at the vertex \f$v_0\f$ to one at the vertex \f$v_1\f$.

\cgalFigureBegin{seg_coord_interp, seg_coord_interp.png}
Segment coordinates (blue) for all the segment points (green) with respect to the vertex \f$v_1 = (2.0,\ 0.4)\f$.
\cgalFigureEnd

If we want to plot triangle coordinates, we follow a similar approach. 
We take \ref tri_example "a triangle" \f$[v_0, v_1, v_2]\f$ in the plane and sample 
its interior and boundary with a number of points. Once we have this sampling, 
we plot one of the triangle coordinate functions (here with respect to the third vertex of the triangle) 
at all the defined sample points. Likewise, we can plot the coordinate function with respect 
to the first or second vertex. The resulting function is linear (shown in the figure below) 
that grows from zero along the first edge \f$[v_0, v_1]\f$ to one at the chosen vertex \f$v_2\f$.

\cgalFigureBegin{tri_coord_interp, tri_coord_interp.png}
Triangle coordinates with respect to \f$v_2 = (1.0,\ 2.0)\f$. 
The color bar indicates the range of values for the chosen coordinate.
\cgalFigureEnd

Since many applications require to work with more complex planar geometric shapes than segments and triangles, 
it seems natural to investigate a generalized version of triangle coordinates with respect 
to arbitrary polygons. The first attempt was taken in 1975 by E. L. Wachspress \cgalCite{cgal:bc:w-rfeb-75}, 
and the resulting generalized barycentric coordinates are now called Wachspress 
coordinates \cgalCite{cgal:bc:mlbd-gbcip-02}. \ref gbc_deg_wachspress_coordinates "These coordinates" 
are well-defined for arbitrary <em>strictly convex polygons</em> and have all the properties 
of triangle coordinates \cgalCite{cgal:bc:fhk-gcbcocp-06}. Unfortunately, they are not well-defined 
for weakly convex and concave polygons.

Analogously to the previous cases, we want to plot the Wachspress coordinates and see how they look like. 
Let us choose a \ref wp_polygon "non-regular hexagon", slightly rotate it, and move one of its 
vertices towards the line through its two adjacent neighbors. We sample the interior and 
the boundary of this polygon as before and plot the coordinate function with respect to 
the vertex that we moved at all the sample points. We see that we get a smooth function, 
which is linear along all edges and grows from zero to one, as the color bar indicates.

Another type of generalized barycentric coordinates goes back to Pinkall and Polthier 
in 1993 \cgalCite{cgal:pp-cdmsc-93} and Eck et al. in 1995 \cgalCite{cgal:bc:eddhls-maam-95} 
in the context of \ref chapsurface_mesh_parameterization "triangle mesh parameterization". 
They are called discrete harmonic coordinates. \ref gbc_deg_discrete_harmonic_coordinates "These coordinates" 
are well-defined, similarly to Wachspress coordinates, for arbitrary <em>strictly convex polygons</em> and 
inherit all the properties of triangle coordinates <em>apart from the positivity inside a polygon</em> 
because they can take on negative values \ref gbc_deg_discrete_harmonic_coordinates "for some polygons". 
Another interesting property of these coordinate functions is that they coincide with Wachspress coordinates 
for any polygon whose vertices lie on a common circle.

To plot discrete harmonic coordinates, we take \ref wp_plot "the same polygon" as for Wachspress coordinates 
and plot the coordinate function with respect to the same vertex. Again, we get a smooth function, 
which is linear along all edges and grows from zero to one. Isolines in the plot show 
the difference between discrete harmonic and Wachspress coordinates for the chosen polygon and vertex.

One of the other type of generalized barycentric coordinates that we discuss are 
mean value coordinates \cgalCite{cgal:f-mvc-03} proposed by M. Floater in 2003. 
Based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_value_theorem">mean value theorem</a>, 
\ref gbc_deg_mean_value_coordinates "these coordinates", unlike Wachspress and 
discrete harmonic coordinates, are well-defined for arbitrary <em>simple polygons</em>, 
inherit all the properties of triangle coordinates for any convex polygon, and 
<em>lack only the positivity property for general concave polygons</em>. 
Hormann and Floater prove in \cgalCite{cgal:bc:hf-mvcapp-06} that these coordinates 
are positive inside the kernel of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-shaped_polygon">star-shaped polygon</a>. 
They are also positive in the closure of any quadrilateral. Like discrete harmonic weights, 
mean value weights are often used in the context 
of \ref chapsurface_mesh_parameterization "triangle mesh parameterization."

In order to show the particular behavior of mean value coordinates with an application to concave polygons, 
we take \ref mv_example "a star-shaped polygon" with ten vertices \f$[v_0, \dots, v_9]\f$, 
sample its interior and boundary, and plot the coordinate function with respect to 
the fourth vertex \f$v_3\f$. As the color bar indicates, the obtained function grows 
from a slightly negative value to one at the chosen vertex. 
It is also smooth inside the polygon and linear along all edges.

<b>Interesting fact</b>: all the coordinates discussed above come from one and the same 
family of generalized barycentric coordinates named <em>3-point family of coordinates</em> \cgalCite{cgal:bc:fhk-gcbcocp-06}.

Since mean value coordinates can still be negative inside a general concave polygon, it was 
observed in \cgalCite{cgal:bc:fhk-gcbcocp-06} that one way of acquiring coordinate functions, which 
inherit all properties from triangle coordinates inside any simple polygon is to solve the 
<em> Laplace equation</em> \f$\Delta b = 0\f$ subject to suitable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_boundary_condition">
Dirichlet boundary conditions</a>. These boundary conditions are given by a set of 
piecewise linear functions such that each function from the set has the Lagrange property.
The resulting coordinates are called harmonic coordinates. The classical way [Joshi et al., 2007] 
to approximate these coordinates is by discretizing the Laplace equation above over 
the space of piecewise linear functions with respect to a triangulation of the input polygon.

To show that, in fact, harmonic coordinates are non-negative inside an arbitray concave polygon,
we take \ref height_inter_example "a complicated concave polygon" with 50 vertices, 
sample its interior and boundary, and plot the harmonic coordinate function with respect to 
the first vertex. As the color bar and isolines indicate, the obtained function 
is non-negative and smooth.

...a figure with harmonic interpolation to be added later...

Apart from the coordinates mentioned above, many other generalized barycentric coordinates 
were proposed to fulfill some other properties or requirements.
