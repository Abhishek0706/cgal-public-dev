\ccDefinition
%============

The class \ccRefName{} is a model of the \ccc{ArrangementTraits_2} concept
and can be used to construct and maintain arrangements of bounded segments of
algebraic curves of degree $2$ at most, also known as {\sl conic curves}.

A general conic curve $C$ is the locus of all points $(x,y)$ satisfying the
equation: $r x^2 + s y^2 + t x y + u x + v y + w = 0$, where: 
\begin{itemize}
\item If $4 r s - t^2 > 0$, $C$ is an ellipse.
      A special case occurs when $r = s$ and $t = 0$, when $C$
      becomes a circle. 
\item If $4 r s - t^2 < 0$, $C$ is a hyperbola. 
\item If $4 r s - t^2 = 0$, $C$ is a parabola.
      A degenerate case occurs when $r = s = t = 0$, when $C$ is a line.
\end{itemize}

A {\sl bounded conic arc} is defined as either of the following: 
\begin{itemize}
\item A full ellipse (or a circle) $C$. 
\item The tuple $\langle C, p_s, p_t, o \rangle$, where $C$ is the supporting
      conic curve, with the arc endpoints being $p_s$ and $p_t$ 
      (the source and target points, respectively). The orientation $o$  
      indicates whether we proceed from $p_s$ to $p_t$ in a clockwise or in a
      counterclockwise direction. Note that $C$ may also
      correspond to a line or to pair of lines --- in this case $o$ may
      specify a \ccc{COLLINEAR} orientation.
\end{itemize}

A very useful subset of the set of conic arcs are line segments and circular
arcs, as arrangements of circular arcs and line segments have some
interesting applications (e.g. offsetting polygons, motion planning for a
disc robot, etc.). Circular arcs and line segment are simpler objects and can
be dealt with more efficiently than arbitrary arcs. For these reasons, it is
possible to construct conic arcs from segments and from circles. Using these
constructors is highly recommended: It is more straightforward and also speeds 
up the arrangement  construction. However, in case the set of input curves
contain only circular arcs and line segments, it is recommended to use the
\ccc{Arr\_circle\_segment\_2} class to achieve faster running times.

In our representation, all conic coefficients (namely $r, s, t, u, v, w$)
must be rational numbers. This guarantees that the coordinates of all
arrangement vertices (in particular, those representing intersection
points) are algebraic numbers of degree $4$ (a real number $\alpha$
is an algebraic number of degree $d$ if there exist a polynomial $p$ with
{\sl integer} coefficient of degree $d$ such that $p(\alpha) = 0$).
We therefore require separate representations of the curve coefficients and
the point coordinates. The \ccc{NtTraits} should be instantiated with a class
that defines nested \ccc{Integer}, \ccc{Rational} and \ccc{Algebraic}
number types and supports various operations on them, yielding certified
computation results (for example, it can convert rational numbers to algebraic
numbers and can compute roots of polynomials with integer coefficients).
The other template parameters, \ccc{RatKernel} and \ccc{AlgKernel} should be
geometric kernels templated with the \ccc{NtTraits::Rational} and
\ccc{NtTraits::Algebraic} number types, respectively.
It is recommended to instantiate the \ccc{CORE_algebraic_number_traits}
class as the \ccc{NtTraits} parameter, with
\ccc{Cartesian<NtTraits::Rational>} and \ccc{Cartesian<NtTraits::Algebraic>}
instantiating the two kernel types, respectively.
The number types in this case are provided by the {\sc Core} library, with its
ability to exactly represent simple algebraic numbers.

The traits class inherits its point type from \ccc{AlgKernel::Point_2},
and defines a curve and $x$-monotone curve types, as detailed below.
The traits class also defines a \ccc{Compare_at_x_left_2} functor and
defines \ccc{Has_left_category} to be \ccc{Tag_true}.

The traits-class also models the \ccc{ArrangementLandmarkTraits_2} concept
and defines \ccc{Has_construct_x_monotone_curve_2_category} to
be \ccc{Tag_true}.

While the \ccRefName{} models the concept
\ccc{ArrangementDirectionalXMonotoneTraits_2}, the implementation of
the \ccc{Arr_mergeable_2} operation does not enforce the input curves
to have the same direction as a precondition. Moreover, \ccRefName{}
supports the merging of curves of opposite directions.

%=========================================================================

The \ccc{Curve_2} class nested within the conic-arc traits can represent
arbitrary conic arcs and support their construction in various ways.
The copy and default constructor as well as the assignment operator are
provided for conic arcs. In addition, an \ccc{operator<<}
for the curves is defined for standard output streams.

  {indicates whether \ccVar{} is a valid conic arc. As the precondition to
   some of the constructor listed above are quite complicated, their

%==============================================================================

The \ccc{X_monotone_curve_2} class nested within the conic-arc traits is
used to represent $x$-monotone conic arcs. It inherits from the \ccc{Curve_2}
type, therefore supports the access methods and the operations listed above.

For efficiency reasons, we recommend users not to construct $x$-monotone
conic arc directly, but rather use the \ccc{Make_x_monotone_2} functor
supplied by the conic-arc traits class to convert conic curves to
$x$-monotone curves.
