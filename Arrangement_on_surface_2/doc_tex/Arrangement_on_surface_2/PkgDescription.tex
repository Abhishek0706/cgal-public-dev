\ccPkgSummary{
This package can be used to construct, maintain, alter, and display
arrangements in the plane. Once an arrangement is constructed, the
package can be used to obtain results of various queries on the
arrangement, such as point location. The package also includes generic
implementations of two algorithmic frameworks, that are, computing the
zone of an arrangement, and line-sweeping the plane, the arrangements
is embedded on. These frameworks are used in turn in the
implementations of other operations on arrangements. Computing the
overlay of two arrangements, for example, is based on the sweep-line
framework. 

Arrangements and arrangement components can also be extended to store
additional data. An important extension stores the construction
history of the arrangement, such that it is possible to obtain the
originating curve of an arrangement subcurve.}
