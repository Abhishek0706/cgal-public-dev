\ccPkgSummary{
This package  allows to build and handle
triangulations for point sets in three dimensions.
Any \cgal\ triangulation covers the convex hull of its
vertices. Triangulations are build incrementally 
and can be modified by insertion, displacements or removal of vertices. 
They offer point location facilities.

The package provides plain triangulation (whose faces
depends on the  insertion order of the vertices) and
Delaunay triangulations.  Regular triangulations are
also provided for sets of weighted points.
Delaunay and regular
triangulations offer nearest neighbor queries
and primitives to build the dual Voronoi and power diagrams.}
