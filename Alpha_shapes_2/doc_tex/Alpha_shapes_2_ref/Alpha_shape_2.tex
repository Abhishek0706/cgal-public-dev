\begin{ccRefClass} {Alpha_shape_2<Dt>}

\ccDefinition

The class \ccClassTemplateName\ represents the family of
$\alpha$-shapes of points in a plane for {\em all} positive
$\alpha$. It maintains the underlying triangulation \ccc{Dt} which
represents connectivity and order among its faces. Each
$k$-dimensional face of the \ccc{Dt} is associated with
an interval that specifies for which values of $\alpha$ the face
belongs to the $\alpha$-shape. There are links between the intervals
and the $k$-dimensional faces of the triangulation.

Note that this class is at the same time used for {\em basic} and
for {\em weighted} Alpha Shapes\ccIndexMainItem[C]{Weighted_alpha_shapes_2}.

This class is the underlying triangulation class.

\ccHeading{I/O}

The I/O operators are defined for \ccc{iostream}. The format for the iostream
is an internal format. 

\ccInclude{CGAL/IO/io.h}

\ccFunction{ostream& operator<<(ostream& os,

\ccPrecond The insert operator must be defined for \ccc{Point}.}


\ccImplementation
The set of intervals associated with the
$k$-dimensional faces of the underlying triangulation are
stored in \ccc{multimaps}.

The cross links between the intervals and the $k$-dimensional faces of the
triangulation are realized using methods in the $k$-dimensional faces
themselves.

\ccc{A.alpha find} uses linear search, while 
\ccc{A.alpha lower bound} and \ccc{A.alpha upper bound} 
use binary search.
\ccc{A.number of solid components} performs a graph traversal and takes time
linear in the number of faces of the underlying triangulation.
\ccc{A.find optimal alpha} uses binary search and takes time
$O(\mbox{ \em n } \log{\mbox{ \em n } })$, where  $n$ is the number of points.
