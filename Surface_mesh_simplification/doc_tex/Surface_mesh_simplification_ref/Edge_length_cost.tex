\ccDefinition

The class \ccRefName\ provides a model for the \ccc{GetCost} concept.
It has one template argument: the type of surface being simplified,
which must be a model of the \ccc{EdgeCollapsableMesh} concept.
It computes the collapse cost as the squared length of the edge.

  {Returns the {\em collapse cost} as the squared distance between the points
  of the source and target vertices (that is, \ccc{profile.p0()} and \ccc{profile.p1()}.\\
  The \ccc{placement} argument is ignored.
