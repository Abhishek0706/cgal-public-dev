\ccDefinition

The concept \ccRefName\ describes the requirements for the {\em policy
function object} which gets the {\em collapse placement} of an edge,
that is, the new position of the vertex that remains after a 
halfedge-collapse operation.

The placement returned is a \ccc{boost::optional} value (i.e., it can
be absent). An absent result indicates that the remaining vertex 
must be kept in place, not moved to a new position.
