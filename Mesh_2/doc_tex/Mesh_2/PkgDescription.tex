\ccPkgSummary{
This package implements a Delaunay refinement algorithm to construct 
conforming triangulations and 2D meshes.

Conforming Delaunay triangulations are obtained from constrained
Delaunay triangulations by refining constrained edges until they are
Delaunay edges. Conforming Gabriel triangulations  are obtained by further
refining constrained edges until they become Gabriel edges.

The package provides also a 2D mesh generator that refines triangles
and constrained edges until user defined size and shape criteria on triangles
are satisfied. 
The package can handle intersecting input constraints 
and set no restriction on the angle formed
 by two constraints sharing an endpoint.}
