Shape Detection

This CGAL package implements the Efficient RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) approach 
for detecting arbitrary shapes in an unorganized point set with unoriented normals 
and the Region Growing approach for detecting shapes in a set of arbitrary items. 
For the latter approach, CGAL provides three particular instances of the algorithm: 
detecting lines on 2D points, detecting planes on 3D points, 
and detecting planes on a polygon mesh.
