Shape Detection
This CGAL package implements an efficient RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) approach for detecting arbitrary shapes in an unorganized point set with unoriented normals and a region growing approach for detecting arbitrary shapes
over a set of arbitrary items. For the region growing approach CGAL provides three particular instances of the algorithm: detecting lines over 2D points, detecting planes over 3D points, and detecting planes
over an arbitrary face graph.
