This CGAL package implements an efficient RANSAC (random sample consensus) approach for detecting shapes in a point set with unoriented normals. 
Five canonical shapes can be detected: planes, spheres, cylinders, cones, and tori. Additional shapes can be detected, given a custom shape class by the user.

In addition to the RANSAC approach, a generic region growing algorithm is implemented. This algorithm can grow regions 
and detect shapes over a set of arbitrary items. In particular, CGAL provides three instances of the algorithm: detecting lines over 2D points, 
detecting planes over 3D points, and detecting planes over an arbitrary face graph. Other instances can be easily added by the user.
