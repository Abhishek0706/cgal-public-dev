This CGAL package implements the Efficient RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) approach 
for detecting shapes in a point set with unoriented normals. Five canonical shapes 
can be detected: planes, spheres, cylinders, cones, and tori. 
Additional shapes can be detected, given a custom shape class by the user.

In addition to the RANSAC approach, the generic Region Growing algorithm is implemented. 
This algorithm can detect shapes in a set of arbitrary items. In particular, 
CGAL provides three instances of the algorithm: detecting lines on 2D points, 
detecting planes on 3D points, and detecting planes on a polygon mesh. 
Other custom instances can be easily added by the user.
