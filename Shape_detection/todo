1. Add the callback mechanism to region growing. See the RANSAC code or the current version of the Region Growing in CGAL. There is an example in RANSAC folder.
2. Add a sorting class by line/plane quality. See the current version of the Region Growing in CGAL or my code.
3. Test different use cases on different data.
4. Add all necessary property maps to be able to use plane regularization with region growing on points 3.
