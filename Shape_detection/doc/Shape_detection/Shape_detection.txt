\section Shape_detection_Introduction Introduction

This \cgal component implements two algorithms for shape detection:

- the __Efficient RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus)__ method, contributed by Schnabel et al. \cgalCite{schnabel2007efficient};
- the __Region Growing__ method, contributed by Lafarge and Mallet \cgalCite{cgal:lm-clscm-12}.


\section Shape_detection_RANSAC Efficient RANSAC

From an unstructured point set with unoriented normals, this algorithm detects a set of shapes (see \cgalFigureRef{Efficient_RANSAC_overview}). 
Five types of primitive shapes are provided by this package: plane, sphere, cylinder, cone, and torus. Other primitive shapes can be easily added 
by the user (see \ref Shape_detection_RANSACExample_with_custom_shapes).

This method takes as input a point set with unoriented normals and provides as output a set of detected shapes with associated input points. 
The output of the algorithm is a set of detected shapes with assigned points and all remaining points not covered by these shapes. 
Each input point can be assigned to at most one detected shape.

The shapes are detected via a RANSAC-type approach, i.e., a random sample consensus. The basic RANSAC approach repeats the following steps: 

-# Randomly select samples from the input points; 
-# Fit a shape to the selected samples; 
-# Count the number of inliers to the shape, inliers being within a user-specified error tolerance to the shape. 

Steps 1-3 are repeated for a prescribed number of iterations and the shape with the highest number of inliers, referred to as largest shape, is kept. 

In our context, the error between a point and a shape is defined by its distance and normal deviation to the shape. 
A random subset corresponds to the minimal number of points (with normals) required to uniquely define a primitive.

For very large point sets, the basic RANSAC method is not practical when testing all possible shape candidates against the input data in order to find the largest shape. 
The main idea behind the Efficient RANSAC method is testing shape candidates against subsets of the input data. 
Shape candidates are constructed until the probability to miss the largest candidate is lower than a user-specified threshold. 
The largest shape is repeatedly extracted until no more shapes, restricted to cover a minimum number of points, can be extracted. 
An additional gain in efficiency is achieved through exploiting the normal attributes during initial shape construction and enumeration of inliers.

The \a support of a shape refers to the footprint of the points covered by the primitive. 
To avoid generating shapes with fragmented support, we enforce a connectivity constraint by considering only one connected component, referred to as \a cluster, 
selected as the one covering the largest number of inliers. See Section \ref Shape_detection_RANSACParameters for more details.


\subsection Shape_detection_RANSACParameters Parameters

The algorithm has five parameters:

- `epsilon` and `normal_threshold`:
The error between a point-with-normal \f$p\f$ and a shape \f$S\f$ is defined by its Euclidean distance and normal deviation to \f$S\f$. 
The normal deviation is computed between the normal at \f$p\f$ and the normal of \f$S\f$ at the closest projection of \f$p\f$ onto \f$S\f$. 
The parameter `epsilon` defines the absolute maximum tolerance Euclidean distance between a point and a shape. 
A high value for `epsilon` leads to the detection of fewer large shapes and hence a less detailed detection. 
A low value for `epsilon` yields a more detailed detection, but may lead to either lower coverage or over-segmentation. 
Over-segmentation translates into detection of fragmented shapes when `epsilon` is within or below the noise level. 
When the input point set is made of free-form parts, a higher tolerance `epsilon` allows for detecting more primitive shapes that approximate some of the free-form surfaces. 
The impact of this parameter is depicted by Figure \cgalFigureRef{Efficient_RANSAC_parameter_epsilon_variation}. Its impact on performance is evaluated in Section \ref Shape_detection_RANSACPerformance.

\cgalFigureBegin{Efficient_RANSAC_parameter_epsilon_variation, Efficient_RANSAC/epsilon_variation2.png}
Impact of the epsilon parameter over levels of detail of the detection. 
(a) Input point set. 
(b) Detection of planar shapes with `epsilon` set to 2.0 (one color per detected shape). Most details such as chimneys on the roof are not distinguished. 
(c) Detection with `epsilon` set to 0.5. The facades are correctly detected and some details of the roof are detected. 
(d) Setting `epsilon` to 0.25 yields a more detailed but slightly over-segmented detection.
\cgalFigureEnd

- `cluster_epsilon`:
The Efficient RANSAC uses this parameter to cluster the points into connected components covered by a detected shape. 
For developable shapes that admit a trivial planar parameterization (plane, cylinder, cone), 
the points covered by a shape are mapped to a 2D parameter space chosen to minimize distortion and best preserve arc-length distances. 
This 2D parameter space is discretized using a regular grid, and a connected component search is performed to identify the largest cluster. 
The parameter `cluster_epsilon` defines the spacing between two cells of the regular grid, so that two points separated by a distance of at most \f$2\sqrt{2}\f$ `cluster_epsilon` are considered adjacent. 
For non-developable shapes, the connected components are identified by computing a neighboring graph in 3D and walking in the graph. 
The impact of the parameter `cluster_epsilon` is depicted in Figure \cgalFigureRef{Efficient_RANSAC_parameter_connectivity}.

\cgalFigureBegin{Efficient_RANSAC_parameter_connectivity, Efficient_RANSAC/varying_connectivity.png}
The parameter `cluster_epsilon` controls the connectivity of the points covered by a detected shape. 
The input point set is sampled on four coplanar squares. 
(a) A large value for `cluster_epsilon` leads to detecting a single planar shape. 
(b) A moderate value for `cluster_epsilon` yields the detection of four squares. Notice that a few points within the squares are not detected as not connected. 
(c) A small value for `cluster_epsilon` leads to over-segmentation.
\cgalFigureEnd

- `min_points`:
The minimum number of points controls the termination of the algorithm. 
The shape search is iterated until no further shapes can be found with a higher support. 
Note that this parameter is not strict: depending on the chosen probability, shapes may be extracted with a number of points lower than the specified parameter.

- `probability`:
This parameter defines the probability to miss the largest candidate shape. 
A lower probability provides a higher reliability and determinism at the cost of longer running time due to a higher search endurance.


\subsection Shape_detection_RANSACExamples Examples
The main class `Shape_detection::Efficient_RANSAC` takes a template parameter `Shape_detection::Efficient_RANSAC_traits` that defines the geometric types and input format. 
Property maps provide a means to interface with user-specific data structures. 
The first parameter of the `Shape_detection::Efficient_RANSAC_traits` class is the common `Kernel`. 
In order to match the constraints of property maps, an iterator type and two maps that map an iterator to a point and a normal are specified in the `Shape_detection::Efficient_RANSAC_traits` class. 
The concept behind property maps is detailed in Manual \ref chapterProperty_map "CGAL and Property Maps".

Typical usage consists of five steps:

-# Provide input data via a range iterator;
-# Register shape factories;
-# Choose parameters;
-# Detect;
-# Retrieve detected shapes.


\subsubsection Shape_detection_RANSACExample_minimal Basic Plane Detection

The following minimal example reads a point set from a file and detects only planar shapes. The default parameters are used for detection.

\cgalExample{Shape_detection/Efficient_RANSAC/example_efficient_RANSAC_basic.cpp}


\subsubsection Shape_detection_RANSACExample_with_callback Plane Detection With Callback

The Efficient RANSAC class provides a callback mechanism that enables the user to track the progress of the algorithm. 
It can be used, for example, to terminate the algorithm based on a timeout. 
In the following example, the algorithm stops if it takes more than half a second and prints out the progress made.

\cgalExample{Shape_detection/Efficient_RANSAC/example_efficient_RANSAC_with_callback.cpp}


\subsubsection Shape_detection_RANSACExample_with_parameters Setting Parameters And Using Different Shape Types

This example illustrates the user selection of parameters using the `Shape_detection::Efficient_RANSAC::Parameters` class. 
Shape detection is performed on five shape types (plane, cylinder, sphere, cone, and torus). 
The input point set is sampled on a surface mostly composed of piecewise planar and cylindrical parts, in addition to free-form parts.

Basic information of the detected shapes is written to the standard output: if the shape is either a plane or a cylinder, 
specific parameters are recovered, otherwise the general method `info()` is used to get the shape parameters in a string object. 
Note that specific parameters can be recovered for any of the provided shape.

\cgalExample{Shape_detection/Efficient_RANSAC/example_efficient_RANSAC_with_parameters.cpp}


\subsubsection Shape_detection_RANSACExample_with_point_access Retrieving Points Assigned To Shapes

This example illustrates how to access the points assigned to each shape and compute the mean error. 
A timer measures the running performance.

\cgalExample{Shape_detection/Efficient_RANSAC/example_efficient_RANSAC_with_point_access.cpp}


\subsubsection Shape_detection_RANSACExample_with_custom_shapes Custom Shapes

Other shape types can be detected by implementing a shape class derived from the class `Shape_detection::Shape_base` and registering it to the shape detection factory of the Efficient RANSAC object. 
This class must provide the following functions: 
construct a shape from a small set of given points, 
compute the squared distance from a query point to the shape and 
compute the normal deviation between a query point with the normal and the normal to the shape at the closest point from the query. 
The used shape parameters are added as members to the derived class.

Note that the RANSAC approach is efficient for shapes that are uniquely defined by a small number of points, denoted by the number of required samples. 
The algorithm aims at detecting the largest shape via many random samples, and the combinatorial complexity of possible samples increases rapidly with the number of required samples.

More specifically, the functions to be implemented are defined in the base class `Shape_detection::Shape_base`:

- `Shape_detection::Shape_base::minimum_sample_size()` const: Returns the minimal number of required samples.
- `Shape_detection::Shape_base::create_shape(const std::vector<size_t> &indices)`: The randomly generated samples are provided via a vector of indices. `Shape_detection::Shape_base::point``(std::size_t index)` 
and `Shape_detection::Shape_base::normal``(std::size_t index)` are used to retrieve the actual points and normals (see the example below). 
The provided number of samples might actually be larger than the set minimal number of required samples, depending on the other shape types. 
If the provided samples are not sufficient to define a unique shape, e.g., in a degenerated case, the shape is considered invalid.
- `Shape_detection::Shape_base::squared_distance``(const Point &point)` const: This function computes the squared distance from a query point to the shape. 
It is used for traversing the hierarchical spatial data structure.
- `Shape_detection::Shape_base::squared_distance(std::vector<FT> &distances, const std::vector<size_t> &indices)` and
- `Shape_detection::Shape_base::cos_to_normal``(const std::vector<size_t> &indices, std::vector<FT> &angles)` const.

The last two functions are used to determine the number of inlier points to the shape. They compute respectively the squared distance from a set of points to the shape, 
and the dot product between the point normals and the normals at the shape for the closest points on the shape. 

The access to the actual point and normal data is carried out via `Shape_detection::Shape_base::point``(std::size_t index)` and `Shape_detection::Shape_base::normal``(std::size_t index)` (see the example below). 
The resulting squared distance/dot product is stored in the vector provided as the first argument.

By default, the connected component is detected via the neighbor graph as mentioned above. However, for shapes that admit a faster approach to detect a connected component, 
the user can provide his/her own implementation to extract the connected component via:
- `Shape_detection::Shape_base::connected_component``(std::vector<std::size_t> &indices, FT cluster_epsilon)`: The indices of all supporting points are stored in the vector `indices`. 
All points not belonging to the largest cluster of points are removed from the vector `indices`. 

Another optional method can be implemented to provide a helper function providing the shape parameters written to a string:
- `Shape_detection::Shape_base::info``()`: This function returns a string suitable for printing the shape parameters into a log/console. 
The default solution provides an empty string.

The property maps are used to map the indices to the corresponding points and normals. The following header shows an implementation of a planar shape primitive, 
which is used by the example \ref Shape_detection/Efficient_RANSAC/example_efficient_RANSAC_with_custom_shape.cpp.

\cgalExample{Shape_detection/Efficient_RANSAC/example_efficient_RANSAC_with_custom_shape.h}


\subsection Shape_detection_RANSACPerformance Performance
 
The running time and detection performance of the Efficient RANSAC depend on the chosen parameters. 
A selective error tolerance parameter leads to higher running time and fewer shapes, as many shape candidates are generated to find the largest shape. 
We plot the detection performance against the `epsilon` error tolerance parameter for detecting planes in a complex scene with 5M points, see \cgalFigureRef{Efficient_RANSAC_performance_epsilon}. 
The `probability` parameter controls the endurance when searching for the largest candidate at each iteration. 
It barely impacts the number of detected shapes, has a moderate impact on the size of the detected shapes, and increases the running time. 
We plot the performance against the `probability` parameter, see \cgalFigureRef{Efficient_RANSAC_performance_probability}.

\cgalFigureBegin{Efficient_RANSAC_performance_epsilon, Efficient_RANSAC/epsilon_graph.png}
The graph depicts the number of detected shapes (purple) and the coverage (green), i.e., the ratio assignedPoints / totalPoints, against the `epsilon` tolerance parameter. 
A higher value for `epsilon`, i.e., a more tolerant error, leads to fewer but larger shapes and shorter running times.
\cgalFigureEnd

\cgalFigureBegin{Efficient_RANSAC_performance_probability, Efficient_RANSAC/prob_graph.png}
The graph depicts the time, coverage, and the number of detected primitives against the search endurance parameter, i.e., the `probability` to miss the largest shape at each iteration. 
The number of shapes is stable and the coverage increases when the `probability` is lowered. 
The running time increases significantly as many more candidates are generated during each iteration of the algorithm.

\section Shape_detection_RegionGrowing Region Growing

This shape detection component is based on the Region Growing algorithm applied to a set of user-specified items.
Shapes are detected by growing regions from estimated seeds as follows:

-# Pick the next available seed item;
-# Find its direct neighbors in the data set; 
-# Check if these neighbors satisfy all necessary conditions to be included in the region; 
-# Add all items that satisfy these conditions and repeat the procedure using these items as seed items;
-# If no further neighbor satisfies the conditions, start a new region.

Together with the generic algorithm's implementation `Shape_detection::Region_growing`, three particular instances of this algorithm are provided:

- Line detection on a \ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingPoints "2D point set";
- Plane detection on a \ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingPoints "3D point set";
- Plane detection on a \ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingMesh "polygon mesh".

Other instances can be easily added by the user as explained below. 


\subsection Shape_detection_RegionGrowingFramework Framework

The main class `Shape_detection::Region_growing` is parameterized by 

- `InputRange` with user-defined items, which can be any objects;
- \ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingFramework_connectivity "Connectivity" that provides the means for getting connectivity among the items;
- \ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingFramework_conditions "Conditions" that provides conditions for validating regions.

Using this generic framework, users can detect shapes or simply grow regions on any set of items with 
their own propagation condtions (see \ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingFramework_examples "an example").


\subsubsection Shape_detection_RegionGrowingFramework_connectivity Connectivity

The concept `RegionGrowingConnectivity` provides the means for getting connectivity among given items. 
To create a model that respects this concept, the only requirement on the user-defined class is to implement the function:

- `RegionGrowingConnectivity::get_neighbors()` that should return all items, 
which are defined to be neighbors of the query item. This function is called whenever a new item is queried.


\subsubsection Shape_detection_RegionGrowingFramework_conditions Conditions

The concept `RegionGrowingConditions` provides conditions for validating regions. 
To create a model that respect this concept, three functions in the user-defined class must be implemented:

- `RegionGrowingPropagationConditions::belongs_to_region()` This function checks if a query item 
should belong to the region that is currently getting developed. It is called whenever 
the algorithm tries to add an item to the region.

- `RegionGrowingPropagationConditions::is_valid_region()` This function checks if a region 
satisfies all necessary user-defined conditions. It is called whenever propagation is no 
longer possible for the given seed item. If it is `true`, the region is accepted, otherwise rejected 
and all its items become again available for the algorithm.

- `RegionGrowingPropagationConditions::update()` This function updates all necessary 
information that goes along with the region propagation. It is called each time 
when a new seed item is chosen and each time when we expand current region with several new items.
In the first case, the number of items in the region is one.


\subsubsection Shape_detection_RegionGrowingFramework_examples Examples

This toy example shows how to implement one's own \ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingFramework_connectivity "Connectivity" and 
\ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingFramework_conditions "Conditions" classes, which are used to parameterize the main 
`Shape_detection::Region_growing` class.

We choose a simple custom sphere item. We define three such spheres with the fixed radius and different center points. For each sphere, 
we also manually store indices of its direct neighbors. The function `RegionGrowingConnectivity::get_neighbors()` in the `Connectivity` class that must be 
provided by the user does nothing but accessing these neighbors. The `Conditions` class implements the following necessary functions:

- `RegionGrowingPropagationConditions::belongs_to_region()` - `true` if the first and second spheres are neighbors,
- `RegionGrowingPropagationConditions::is_valid_region()` - always `true` after the first call to the function `update()`:
- `RegionGrowingPropagationConditions::update()` - updates the internal flag from the default `false` to `true`.

The result of using these classes with the Region Growing main class on the spheres above is that the first two spheres form the first region,
while the third sphere forms the second region.

\cgalExample{Shape_detection/Region_growing/example_region_growing_with_custom_classes.cpp}


\subsection Shape_detection_RegionGrowingPoints Points

If one wants to detect lines (see \ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingPoints_examples "2D Example")

\cgalFigureBegin{Region_growing_on_points_2, Region_growing/region_growing_on_points_2.png}
A 2D point set depicted with one color per detected line.
\cgalFigureEnd

or planes (see \ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingPoints_examples "3D Example") 

\cgalFigureBegin{Region_growing_on_points_3, Region_growing/region_growing_on_points_3.png}
A 3D point set depicted with one color per detected plane.
\cgalFigureEnd

on 2D or respectively 3D points, this \cgal component provides the corresponding models of the concepts \ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingFramework_connectivity "Connectivity" 
and \ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingFramework_conditions "Conditions". In particular, it provides two different ways to define neighbors:

- Fuzzy sphere search via `Shape_detection::Points_fuzzy_sphere_connectivity`
This class creates a circle (if the point is 2D) or a sphere (if the point is 3D) centered at the query point with a user-specified search radius. 
All points, which belong to this spherical search space, will be treated as neighbors of the query point;

- Nearest neighbors search via `Shape_detection::Points_k_nearest_neighbors_connectivity`
This class returns K (given by the user) nearest neighbors of the query point either 2D or 3D.

The component also provides least squares line fit conditions for the 2D case and
least squares plane fit conditions for the 3D case. That is, to check if a query point 
belongs to a given region, the program associates this region to the best-fit hyperplane (2D line or 3D plane) and controls the quality of this fit, 
using the corresponding method:

- `Shape_detection::Points_2_least_squares_line_fit_conditions` - line fit for 2D points;
- `Shape_detection::Points_3_least_squares_plane_fit_conditions` - plane fit for 3D points.


\subsubsection Shape_detection_RegionGrowingPoints_parameters Parameters

The classes in Section \ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingPoints "Region Growing On Points" depend on a few parameters 
that should be defined by the user. They also have default values, but these values are not guaranteed 
to work for each case.

- `search_radius` This parameter is used by the class `Shape_detection::Points_fuzzy_sphere_connectivity` 
and defines a radius of a search circe in 2D case and sphere in 3D case;

- `number_of_neighbors` This parameter defines the number K of nearest neighbors in the class `Shape_detection::Points_k_nearest_neighbors_connectivity`.

The right choice for the `search_radius` or `number_of_neighbors` parameters plays an important role in producing a good result. 
For example, if we consider the fuzzy sphere connectivity, when `search_radius` is too large, we have fewer regions, and the details are not clearly separated. 
Meanwhile, if `search_radius` is too small, we produce more regions, and the point set may be over-segmented.
Consider a 2D map of an intersection of streets in a city as in \cgalFigureRef{Region_growing_parameter_search_radius_variation}. 
Each region is painted with a unique color. As `search_radius` increases, the details become less clear. When `search_radius` = 0.3 (c), the best visualization is produced.

\cgalFigureBegin{Region_growing_parameter_search_radius_variation, Region_growing/search_radius_parameter_2D.png}
(a) Input 2D point set;
(b) 17 regions are found when `search_radius` = 0.1; 
(c) 8 regions are found when `search_radius` = 0.3; 
(d) 4 regions are found when `search_radius` = 1.2.
\cgalFigureEnd

The \ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingPoints "Conditions" related classes depend on the following parameters:

- `distance_threshold` - the maximum distance from a point to a line/plane;
- `normal_threshold` - the minimum dot product between the normal associated with a point and the normal of a line/plane;
- `min_region_size` - the minimum number of points a region must have.

The first two parameters are used in the functions `belongs_to_region()` and `update()`, while the third parameter is used in the function `is_valid_region()`
explained in Section \ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingFramework_conditions "Framework Conditions".

The right choice of the `distance_threshold` and `normal_threshold` parameters is also very important. 
For example, Figure \cgalFigureRef{Region_growing_parameter_normal_threshold_variation} shows that the roof top of the house can be distinguished as two planes (painted in blue and dark red) 
when the `normal_threshold` is strict enough (c), or it can be recognized as only one plane (painted in pale yellow) in the other case (b).

(a) Input 3D point cloud; 
(b) Result when `normal_threshold` = 0.5; 
(c) Result when `normal_threshold` = 0.9.
\cgalFigureEnd


\subsubsection Shape_detection_RegionGrowingPoints_examples Examples

Typical usage of the Region Growing component consists of five steps:

-# Define an input range with points;
-# Create instances of the classes `Conditions` and `Connectivity` with the proper parameters or default ones;
-# Create an instance of the `Region_growing` class using the input range and the instances from the previous step;
-# Detect;
-# Postprocess.

Given a 2D point set, in the example below, we detect 2D lines on this set using fuzzy sphere neighbors search. We then color these regions and save them in a file. 
The points with assigned to them normal vectors are stored in `std::vector` and the used `Kernel` is `CGAL::Simple_cartesian`, where the number type is `double`.

\cgalExample{Shape_detection/Region_growing/example_region_growing_on_points_2.cpp}

If we are given a 3D point set, then the example below shows how to detect 3D planes on this set using the K nearest neighbors search. We color found regions 
and save them in a file. The point set with associated normals is stored in `CGAL::Point_set_3` and the used `Kernel` is `CGAL::Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel`.

\cgalExample{Shape_detection/Region_growing/example_region_growing_on_points_3.cpp}


\subsubsection Shape_detection_RegionGrowingPoints_performance Performance

The main parameter that affects the Region Growing algorithm is the neighborhood size at each retrieval (`search_radius` or `number_of_neighbors`). 
Larger neighbor lists are often followed by a smaller number of regions, larger coverage (the ratio between the number of points assigned to regions and the total number of points given as input), 
and longer running time. For example, on a test of about 70k 2D points, the following table is produced:

<table class="markdownTable" align="center">
<tr class="markdownTableHead">
<th class="markdownTableHeadCenter"><code>search_radius</code>  </th><th class="markdownTableHeadCenter">Time (in seconds)  </th><th class="markdownTableHeadCenter">Number of regions  </th><th class="markdownTableHeadCenter">Number of assigned points   </th></tr>
<tr class="markdownTableBody">
<td class="markdownTableBodyCenter">1  </td><td class="markdownTableBodyCenter">0.164965  </td><td class="markdownTableBodyCenter">796  </td><td class="markdownTableBodyCenter">4491   </td></tr>
<tr class="markdownTableBody">
<td class="markdownTableBodyCenter">3  </td><td class="markdownTableBodyCenter">0.115316  </td><td class="markdownTableBodyCenter">3054  </td><td class="markdownTableBodyCenter">63154   </td></tr>
<tr class="markdownTableBody">
<td class="markdownTableBodyCenter">6  </td><td class="markdownTableBodyCenter">0.132817  </td><td class="markdownTableBodyCenter">2483  </td><td class="markdownTableBodyCenter">64977   </td></tr>
<tr class="markdownTableBody">
<td class="markdownTableBodyCenter">9  </td><td class="markdownTableBodyCenter">0.168458 </td><td class="markdownTableBodyCenter">2282  </td><td class="markdownTableBodyCenter">65353   </td></tr>
</table>

If the neighborhood size is set too low, some points might be isolated, the region size would not reach a critical mass and so will be discarded. 
This does not only cause the latency in the program, but also reduces the coverage value, as can be seen when the `search_radius = 1`. The detection performance against another important parameter, 
that is `distance_threshold`, for detecting planes on a 3D point set with about 500k points is shown in Figure \cgalFigureRef{Region_growing_performance_distance_threshold}.

\cgalFigureBegin{Region_growing_performance_distance_threshold, Efficient_RANSAC/epsilon_graph_2.png}
The graph depicts the number of detected shapes (purple) and the coverage (green), i.e., the ratio assignedPoints / totalPoints, 
against the `distance_threshold` parameter (for simplicity, we use the same value for `distance_threshold` and `search_radius`). 
A higher value for `search_radius`, i.e., larger neighborhood spheres, leads to longer running time and to larger shapes.

\subsection Shape_detection_RegionGrowingMesh Polygon Mesh

If one wants to detect planes on a polygon mesh, this \cgal component provides the corresponding models of the cocepts 
\ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingFramework_connectivity "Connectivity" and \ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingFramework_conditions "Conditions".
In particular, it has

- `Shape_detection::Polygon_mesh_adjacent_faces_connectivity` class that retrieves all adjacent faces for a given face, and
- `Shape_detection::Polygon_mesh_least_squares_plane_fit_conditions` class that fits a 3D plane to the vertices of 
all mesh faces, which have been added to the region so far, and controls the quality of this fit.

This component accepts any model of the concept `FaceListGraph` as a polygon mesh. A picture below gives an \ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingMesh_examples "example" 
of the Region Growing algorithm for detecting 3D planes on `CGAL::Surface_mesh`.

\cgalFigureBegin{Region_growing_on_surface_mesh, Region_growing/region_growing_on_polygon_mesh.png}
A surface mesh depicted with one color per detected plane.
\cgalFigureEnd


\subsubsection Shape_detection_RegionGrowingMesh_parameters Parameters

The \ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingMesh "Connectivity" class does not require any parameters, because adjacent faces are found using the internal face graph connectivity, while
the \ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingMesh "Conditions" class depends on three parameters:

- `distance_threshold` - the maximum distance from the furthest face vertex to a plane;
- `normal_threshold` - the minimum dot product between the face normal and the normal of a plane;
- `min_region_size` - the minimum number of mesh faces a region must have.

The first two parameters are used in the functions `belongs_to_region()` and `update()`, while the third parameter is used in the function `is_valid_region()`
explained in Section \ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingFramework_conditions "Framework Conditions". The right choice of these parameters is as important as the one explained 
in Section \ref Shape_detection_RegionGrowingPoints_parameters "Parameters For Region Growing On Points".


\subsubsection Shape_detection_RegionGrowingMesh_examples Examples

In the example below, we show how to use Region Growing to detect planes on a polygon mesh that can be either stored as `CGAL::Surface_mesh` or `CGAL::Polyhedron_3`.
If it is a surface mesh, this example also provides a way to save the result in a file. The used `Kernel` here is `CGAL::Exact_predicates_exact_constructions_kernel`.
Though this exact kernel provides better quality results, please note that it may significantly slow down the execution of the program, so if you need 
a faster version of Region Growing, use a floating type based kernel.

\cgalExample{Shape_detection/Region_growing/example_region_growing_on_polygon_mesh.cpp}


\section Shape_detection_Comparison Comparison

The Efficient RANSAC algorithm is very quick, however, since it is not deterministic, some small shapes might be missed in the detection process.

Instead, the Region Growing algorithm usually takes longer to complete than the Efficient RANSAC, but it may provide better quality output in the presence of large scenes 
with numerous small details: as it iterates throughout all items of the scene, there are fewer chances to miss a shape. 
In addition, it is deterministic (for a given input and a given set of parameters, it always returns the same output, 
whereas as the Efficient RANSAC algorithm is randomized and so the output may vary at each run). See figure \cgalFigureRef{Shape_detection_comparison_figure}.

\section Shape_detection_PlaneRegularization Plane Regularization

Shape detection applies to man-made scenes or objects such as urban scenes or scans of mechanical parts. 
Such scenes often contain a wide range of geometric regularities such as parallelism, orthogonality, or symmetry. 
This package offers a function to reinforce four types of regularities for planar shapes: `CGAL::regularize_planes()`:

- Planes that are near __parallel__ are made parallel: normal vectors of planes that form angles smaller than a user-defined threshold are made equal;
- Parallel planes that are near __coplanar__ are made coplanar;
- Planes that are near __orthogonal__ are made exactly orthogonal;
- Planes that are near __symmetrical__ with respect to a user-defined axis are made symmetrical.

The user can choose to only regularize one or several of these 4 properties (see \link CGAL::regularize_planes() Reference Manual\endlink). 
The process is greedy and based on a hierarchical decomposition (coplanar clusters are subgroups of parallel clusters, 
which are subgroups of axis-symmetric and orthogonal clusters) as described by Verdie et al. \cgalCite{cgal:vla-lod-15}

\section Shape_detection_History History

The Efficient RANSAC implementation was developed by Sven Oesau based on a prototype version created by Yannick Verdie, 
with the help of Cl√©ment Jamin and under the supervision of Pierre Alliez. Plane regularization was added by Simon Giraudot 
based on the prototype version developed by Florent Lafarge.

The Region Growing algorithm on 3D points was first developed by Simon Giraudot based on the prototype version developed by Florent Lafarge 
and then generalized to arbitrary items including versions for 2D points, 3D points, and a polygon mesh by Thien Hoang during the 
Google Summer of Code 2018 under the supervision of Dmitry Anisimov.
